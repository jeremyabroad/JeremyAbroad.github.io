And there are certainly huge advantages, such as being able to host your website for free on GitHub Pages and blazing fast, reliable performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this blog in Gatsbyjs, but I will now be deprecating it for a Wordpress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress? Ew. Doesn’t that use PHP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I just want a simple blog platform where I can focus purely on the content. Any time not spent creating content is a distraction, a literal waste of time. The older you get, the more you realize how precious time is. At the end of the day it’s a website, and nobody except for developers cares about the tools you used to create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last straw was when my laptop broke, and I realized I couldn’t update my blog until it was fixed. If I just had a Wordpress blog (or some kind of admin panel, I’m sure someone’s made one for Gatsby that I’m not aware of), I could just log in from any computer in a PC Cafe and continue posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could find an admin panel solution, or I could just call it a day and use Wordpress. I’d been wanting to ditch Gatsby anyways so, so the decision didn’t take much deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll preface this by saying that you should by all means consider Gatsby if all you want is a simple barebones website that you don’t plan to update much, or if you want to havily customize it in a way that would be difficult with a tried-and-true platform like Wordpress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s why I’m leaving Gatsbyjs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a very limited selection of themes, and nothing I particularly like (though admittedly the selection has improved tremendously since I made this site). Switching themes basically requires a complete rewrite, whereas with something like Wordpress, it’s literally just the click of a button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My website is basic as hell, but I had to do a decent amount of development to even get it to look and function like this (eg. filtering posts by tag, comments), and it’s still way less functional or pretty than any standard WordPress template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical Images look weird (&lt;a href=&quot;/been-a-while/&quot;&gt;eg&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know why this is broken, and a cursory Google search returns nothing. Clearly not everything works out of the box (unlike WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build times take forever, especially when you have ~70 posts like I do. I’m sure part of the slowness is from being on WSL, but still it takes ~40 seconds to build. Then when I want to commit and push that’s like another minute. Meanwhile on WordPress it’s instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing new posts takes forever. I have to create a new folder, create a new Markdown file, set the date, etc. Ok now that I wrote this out I realize I sound like a baby because it would be super easy to add a script to automate this, but still! Why isn’t this there by default? In any case, I prefer being able to click the “Write” button in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with drafts. This is one of the biggest annoyances. Often I would start writing a post, not finish it, write a new post, build and deploy, and then notice that the unfinished post was accidentally pushed - and then having to move the unfinished posts to a “draft” folder (which isn’t possible in Sublime Text sadly) and redeploy (my last post was one of those accidentally published drafts, but I said “screw it I’ll just keep it up” and slapped on a quick and dirty “conclusion” to the end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I could develop some solution to this, but that’s more time wasted developing, less time making content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having an admin panel. This is also one of the biggest issues. It’s just way nicer having a page where you can easily see and update all your posts and drafts, especially if it’s accessible online from any computer (without the potential security risk of it being hacked). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Gatsby just breaks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m writing I’m running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;, and sometimes I’ll notice the page isn’t updating and I’ll check the command line to see it’s crashed with an error like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;error UNHANDLED REJECTION


  FetchError: request to http://localhost:8000/___graphql failed, reason: socket hang up

  - index.js:1455 ClientRequest.&amp;lt;anonymous&amp;gt;
    [jbernier-gatsby]/[gatsby]/[node-fetch]/lib/index.js:1455:11

  - next_tick.js:63 process._tickCallback
    internal/process/next_tick.js:63:19&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this cryptic error? I don’t have time for this. This maybe wouldn’t be as big a deal if it didn’t take a whole minute to build again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time I tried to build my project after a long hiatus, and my project literally wouldn’t build anymore. I was getting some cryptic Gatsby error from an NPM dependency that didn’t return anything on Google. Long story short I was able to fix it by reverting to an older Git commit. Again, any time not spent on creating content for a content-driven website is time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to dissuade you from using a static site generator like Gatsby. They certainly have their use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you just want to make a blog where you frequently update it, then I highly recommend NOT using a static site generator as the additional friction of dealing with one will reduce your productivity and simply be a distraction. To get your website to even a comparable level to any standard WordPress template will require a lot of development work because the default templates (at least for Gatsby) are super basic and rudimentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a new WordPress blog (not this site) where I’ve been posting every single day for the last week. I would never post that frequently for that long on this static website becase just the thought of having to go through all that extra work every day makes me think “screw it I’ll do something else”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course one can take the time to write scripts and automate away a lot of this “friction”, but why bother if WordPress has already solved this problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey if you’re looking to reinvent the wheel and re-solve all this in the static-site generator world, then I encourage you to push it to GitHub and open source it. If enough of this stuff gets developed, then perhaps I’d consider switching back in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a younger and perhaps hungrier engineer (at least in a different way) I spent a ridiculous amount of time coding custom personal websites using libraries like React and creating my own custom frameworks (before Redux) and hosting my own web servers with their databases. Although it was a fantastic learning experience so I can’t say I regret any of it - let’s call a spade a spade here: It’s over-engineering. Great if you want to learn engineering. A distraction and time sink if you want to actually build something useful to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WYSIWYG generators have come a long way. If you’re just making a basic blog or website, there’s not need to waste your time reinventing the wheel by coding unless you’re trying to do something very customized, or are doing it as a learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[It's Been a While...]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wow it’s been a while since I posted here.Why’d I stop posting on this blog?Embarassingly little traffic (+ focusing on other projects).

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why’d I stop posting on this blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embarassingly little traffic (+ focusing on other projects). I could upload a video of myself pointing at the camera while winking to Youtube and it would get more traffic then this sad blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a static site generator and the command line to post is actually kind of annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pictures show up weird (see above). I did some quick Google searches and nothing came up, and I don’t care enough right now to really look into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I much prefer having a web interface as it reduces the friction to nothing, and unfinished posts automatically get saved as drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have it right now, posting requires running a “gatsby build” (takes maybe 20 seconds? too damn long!), make a new commit to the git repository, and push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don’t finish a post, then I have to move it to the “drafts” folder so that it doesn’t get built. My text editor (Sublime Text) somehow doesn’t have a way to move folders in the sidebar, so I have to open up the explorer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok…are any of these the end of the world? No. But when blogging is just something you occasionally do on the side for fun, it’s enough to make me say “f!@# it”, I’d rather do something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don’t I go back to a platform with a web interface? Well whatever the platform is, I like having all of my posts in markdown format (eg. Blogger could theoretically just shut down your account and you’d lose all your posts) and having full control over the site (even if it’s ugly and has no search function right now). I may migrate to Netlify. But really, this site gets so little traffic and I have no ambitions of becoming a famous blogger (do people even still read blogs?) so it’s probably not worth my time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok back to my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I up to right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been living in Seoul, Korea for the last 3.5 months and am liking it here, especially the food. I want to learn the language now - not only to communicate with more people, but if only for the personal challenge of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start applying for remote jobs. I’ve noticed there’s been an increase in quality companies offering remote jobs, which is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 2019 - ever since I started working &lt;a href=&quot;/remote-work&quot;&gt;it always struck me as odd&lt;/a&gt; that many companies insist on confing their workforces domestically to ridiculously expensive cities like NYC/SF that have proven incapable of accommodating reasonably-priced housing for the massive influx of residents (maybe the investors running these companies are landlords themselves?), not to mention other issues like accommodating the ever-increasing insane amount of homeless people and mentally insane people, constant ear-piercing sirens, overcongested sidewalks/streets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a bit removed from that in Seoul. I never see homeless people, I’m in a hip area paying $8/night for accommodation, food is ridiculously delicious and cheap ($5-7 for a fantastic filling meal at a nice restaurant), I’ve got 24/7 coffee shops within walking distance, I’ve never felt unsafe, the air is clean, it’s quiet - yet there’s so much to do, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, here’s my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com/resume.pdf&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremysbernier&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. Contact me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you need a solid remote engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Places I've Been]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here is a list of the cities and countries I’ve been to.

The purpose here isn’t to brag or anything like that, this is literally just for me to keep track of everywhere I’ve been. I’m not including countries I have no memory of because I visited as a young child (eg. apparently I’ve been to Gabon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these countries were visited over the last year and a half when I left NYC to travel the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not on a mission to visit every country for the sole purpose of knocking off some checklist. I think it’s way more meaningful to spend a good amount of time in a single country and really get to know the people, culture, language, etc vs. flying to a capital city for a couple days, checking off landmarks, treating the trip like a visit to your local amusement park, and leaving without any real understanding of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Central America&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love travel as it can broaden one’s horizons and change one’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t mean to instill FOMO. One of the downsides of travel is that you can only visit a place for the first time once. So be curious and go out there and see the world, but if you’re going to visit somewhere - make it count!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the full list as of now. I’ll keep updating it when I get the time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andrew Yang]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andrew Yang is hands-down the most impressive presidential candidate I’ve ever seen, and probably the only political candidate I’ve ever…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/andrew-yang/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/andrew-yang/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 11:12:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang is hands-down the most impressive presidential candidate I’ve ever seen, and probably the only political candidate I’ve ever truly resonated with. I highly recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsEzmFamZ8&quot;&gt;his interview on Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; because he perfectly articulates everything that’s wrong with the U.S. while proposing the bold pragmatic solutions we need to tackle them. Everything he says he backs up with facts and data, this isn’t some charade of empty rhetoric like what most politicians do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pretty vocal about automation and Universal Basic Income ever since I got my first software engineering job 5 years ago. As a software engineer it’s pretty obvious to me that most decent-paying jobs are getting automated away, and we’re not only doing nothing about it - we’re not even acknowledging the problem. Until now I don’t recall a single politician or presidential candidate ever talking about the impending crisis on our labor markets being caused by automation (Trump blamed it on Mexicans and China). And in the few times that it’s ever brought up, the proposed solution is “re-training”, which is complete and utter fantasy nonsense (as Andrew points out, the government has a terrible track record of this). 3.5 million truck drivers with a median age of 55 are not going to become computer programmers (nor should they have to be), and jobs don’t magically crop up to accommodate those who lose them (not to suggest we shouldn’t facilitate re-training, just that it would barely make a dent in fixing the problem, and certainly wouldn’t accommodate everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had honestly begun to lose hope in my country. I left the country a year ago to find my new home because I had no desire to build my future in a country that’s so ideologically not in line with my values, with gridlock that seemed irreconcilable. The fact that this guy is even a viable presidential candidate gives me hope that we might get there way sooner than I had thought, and that I might live to see a rational government in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it seems like a long shot, but if this guy wins the presidency, I will return to the U.S., re-integrate into the labor force, and buy a U.S.A. T-Shirt. I would go from having to explain to people why our citizens don’t have healthcare, are saddled in student loan debt, and our wealthiest cities have more blatant homelessness and poverty than many developing countries, to being able to say that we were the first major country to pioneer our way to the future, a future where technological advancement is unequivocally celebrated rather than something to be feared because “they took er jerbs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways to those who don’t have the time to watch the video, here’s my short summary of my main highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological advancement and automation is wrecking havoc on the labor market and local economies, and we are doing nothing to accommodate the displaced. Re-training can help some, but it will not realistically accommodate the millions of Uber/truck drivers, secretaries, retail workers, etc. who are losing their jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal Basic Income, or the Freedom Dividend, is where everyone gets $1,000/month. This would not solve the problem, but it would eliminate the fear of destitution for those who’s jobs are at risk. Furthermore, it would serve as an investment in the people, enabling people to start business, work on whatever they want, or simply supplement their income and stimulate the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GDP is a narrow metric that says little to nothing about the well-being of the people. We should put more focus on broader metrics that actually reflect our quality of life (eg. health, engagement with one’s work, happiness). We will not improve what we don’t measure, and we need to be more data-driven in our approach. Otherwise nobody is accountable for anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In my opinion GDP and [U3] unemployment rate get way more focus than they deserve, as if they’re the sole barometers of the quality of our lives)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok this post is too long so I’ll leave it there. Whether or not you like the idea of a freedom dividend, we need to be doing more to accommodate those whose jobs are being displaced by automation, something that’s already happening and is only accelerating. Trump won because he won the votes in these regions that’ve been decimated by auomation. But Trump is a narcissistic idiot who blames it on Mexicans and China, and wants to declare a state of emergency for a stupid wall that won’t accomplish anything and nobody cares about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian guy who likes math”. We need more rational thinkers like Andrew Yang in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need 23k more individual donations ($1 is enough) to get him to the debate stage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yang2020.com/&quot;&gt;shoot over a dollar&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see him there (apparently he was on the U.S. National Debate Team).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yang2020.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.yang2020.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also feel free to debate me on any of this, I love talking about this stuff because I don’t think there’s anything more important.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Long Neck Village Impressions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I visited one of the villages habitated by the Karen Tribe, famous for the neck rings that the women wear.

&lt;p&gt;Today I visited one of the villages habitated by the Karen Tribe, famous for the neck rings that the women wear. Originally from Burma, many of the Karen fled to Thailand during the war as refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many villages in Thailand (and Burma) where the Karen tribe reside, but I specifically went to Huay Pu Keng because I was told it was the least touristy, 30 minutes outside Mae Hong Son. I drove there by motorbike on a long winding road through the mountains that was scenic and fun to drive through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get there you can take a boat to cross the river for 20 baht (note: do not take a boat from the earlier exit because they charge something like 800 baht). The entrance fee was 200 baht.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Village&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village is pretty small, with a short little walkway going uphill and the women having their goods out on display. Most of the women are making scarves or just hanging out, with their children running around. Most but not all of the women and children wear the neck rings. They don’t solicit you, many don’t even make eye contact unless you approach them. Everyone seems to speak fluent English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went a bit off the main path and saw children playing volleyball, a Christian church, and other houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no internet or cell phone coverage. The school supposingly has some computers, and some of the people have phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived to the boat there were two women women getting off wearing neck rings and that’s when it hit me that “oh sh*t this is real”. I checked my phone and saw that I had no service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay Yu, the man who drove my boat, was very friendly and told me a lot about life in the village. He told me that the women were allowed to choose whether or not to wear the rings, that there was no electricity in the village aside from the solar panels, and that many of the men didn’t have Thai citizenship (being Burmese refugees) and thus struggled to find work. The school in the village had recently been transformed to teach Thai. He was married but his wife didn’t wear the rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asked me what state I was from and I said “Virginia”, and then he said “that’s one of the original colonies right?” (impressive, many foreigners from wealthier countries aren’t familiar with Virginia) From the age of 17, he’d spent 4 years going to school in the Karen refugee camp (high school and a little bit of university I believe) and then had volunteered there for another two years. He said he’d like to travel one day but didn’t have the money to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Karen are originally from Burma, neither him nor any of the villagers I spoke to expressed any desire to move back to Burma. He told me that Thailand was better because healthcare and education were cheaper here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He encouraged me to talk to the people in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it felt weird because this is a real village where people live. The women were wearing neck rings but just going about their business, and it felt weird staring at them. There were only a few other tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I remembered that I’d paid an entrance fee and decided that I wasn’t going to waste this opportunity, and so I approached a mother and her child and talked to them for a bit. The mother was very friendly and didn’t hesitate to answer any of my questions. She told me she was content living in the village and had no desire to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She spoke fluent English, as did every other villager. I found this extremely impressive, especially given that there’s no internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to a 27 year old woman who turned out to be the sister of the boat driver. She was married and seemed happy, but told me she might move to the city in a couple years to work, something she could do because she had Thai citizenship. Of course this would mean taking off the neck rings. Her husband on the other hand was Burmese and didn’t have Thai citizenship, and thus couldn’t legally work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she had a Facebook account but wasn’t on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the neck rings can be taken off, contrary to popular belief. I asked her if she actually wears the rings all the time, such as when she sleeps or showers, and she insisted that she does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could try on a neck ring and she put some on. It was a bit heavy and my neck of course felt very constricted. I could not look down. I’m glad I don’t have to wear these rings, though I do think they look cool on the women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see some Christian churches, the first I’ve seen in my 3 weeks so far in Thailand. I asked one of the ladies what her religion was and she said Buddhist, though she said that there were Protestants and Catholics as well. The impression I got was that most however were Buddhist. She said that all the religions got along with each other in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I found it to be a very interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed at their fluency in English. Their English was better than the average person in any South American or Ukrainian city, which is remarkable given that they’re living in a village with no internet or cell phone coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with those who can’t get Thai citizenship and thus can’t legally work in Thailand. I think the government should do more to help these people. That being said, it would be unfair to single out the Thai government here because many countries nowadays (including the U.S.) are guilty of failing to integrate refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people seemed remarkably content with their situation other than those without Thai citizenship who couldn’t legally work. I was expecting more of a desire to move to the city, but that was not the sense I got, though to be fair the people I spoke to constitute a very small sample size. Living in the city is expensive, and life seemed easier there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not having internet or cell phone coverage, they definitely seem to have been exposed to the computer and the internet, so they’re not totally isolated from the outside world. I was surprised that the one woman had a Facebook accout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Technological Advancement Good?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find villages fascinating because life there is so different from what I’m used to having lived in the Washington D.C. area and NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of me wants to help out these villages by helping to connect them to the internet and supply them with phones and laptops, but another part of me questions whether this is actually a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the average American or Japanese salaryman happier than the average villager here in Thailand or in Cuba? Is social media good, or does it make us feel inadequate and FOMO by exposing us to “dream” lifestyles we can never obtain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your stance on technology, I think there’s a clear case to be made that work in the modern era is extroardinarily alienating for many people when their time is completely devoted to soulless jobs devoid of meaning or fulfillment, much of the money going to rent and/or mortgage often with little left over. This sentiment was summed up beautifully in the (excellent) documentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/pov/lostboysofsudan/video-lostboysofsudan/&quot;&gt;Lost Boys of Sudan&lt;/a&gt; when a Sudanese person says “in Africa we have time but no money, but in the U.S. there is money but no time”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to explore more villages and perhaps volunteer in one to learn more about the lives of villagers and their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to visit the village, I highly recommend actually talking to the locals and learning about their culture and way of life. This was by far the most rewarding thing I did here, and had I not done this I would’ve only gotten a fraction of the experience. I didn’t actually see any other tourists doing this, most of them just walking around and taking pictures. I know it might feel weird, as though you’re intruding, but it’s not, and if anything that’s what you’re paying the 200 baht entrance fee for. I tipped every person I spoke to (some of whom tried to refuse the tip) but of course that is up to your discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Controversy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I will address the controversy, the accusations that this is a “human zoo”, that visiting this is unethical, that they’re held against their will, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the people I spoke to said they were being held against their will. All told me they could leave if they wanted to, and one lady even told me that she planned to move to the city in a couple years. Most of the husbands work in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that many do not have Thai citizenship and thus cannot legally work. This is a problem and should be resolved. That being said, this is unfortunately not really different from how most countries handle refugees (including the U.S.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I went directly to the village without going through a tour or middleman, all the money I spent goes directly to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is it possible that I was lied to and that they’re secretly held hostage there? Sure. But after speaking to four people, two of them for at least 15-20 minutes, getting their emails and contact information, I did not get that impression. The man I spoke to worked in the city and was simply on holiday for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If indeed they are being exploited and held hostage, then that is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. But it is not the impression I got after speaking to these people. The burden of proof regarding any allegations of exploitation is on the accuser, and I see a lot of people throwing around accusations without any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it, a lot of people are uncomfortable with what some call “poverty tourism”. When I was in South America it seemed that at least half of the tourists were uncomfortable with favela tours (though half of them would do it anyways and then afterwards claim they were still uncomfortable with it). I always thought this thinking was stupid, as if touring through Beverley Hills or the Upper East Side and padding the pockets of billionaires is more ethical and morally acceptible than visiting a slum and supporting their economy. By this logic, isn’t the whole concept of visiting a “poor” country unethical? Guess I should cancel that trip to India and Madagascar and book another trip to London and Paris /s. What utter nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I gave money to the village, learned about their culture, and have now raised awareness of their village and culture via writing this post. There’s a legitimate possibility I may go back and volunteer in the village or the refugee camp because I find it so interesting and think it would be rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything I did was “unethical”, then please educate me on how so. But please back up any allegations with evidence, along with your reasoning as to how me visiting this village made these people any worse off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Objectives Society Should Strive For - Freedom and Technological Advancement]]></title><description><![CDATA[The media fixates on GDP and unemployment rate.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media fixates on GDP and unemployment rate. When GDP is high and unemployment is low, the economy is considered to be doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course GDP and unemployment rate are very narrow metrics with severe flaws that are well-documented, so I won’t get into them in detail in this article. But here’s a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP: Sum of all monetary transactions in an economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaws: The amount of money changing hands says nothing about standard of living, quality of life, distribution of wealth, or externalities such as the effects on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment rate (U3) flaws: Says nothing about wages, quality of jobs (eg. autonomy) or meaningfulness of jobs (eg. in New Jersey and Oregon its illegal to pump gas, this creates jobs but is a net waste). A physics PhD working part-time as a barista because he/she can’t find a job that utilizes his/her skills is counted as employed while a discouraged worker is left out of the statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I will propose two new objectives that society should strive to maximize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom (freedom of time, economic freedom, political freedom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological Advancement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom of Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is of course a broad term that encompasses many things. But the most important freedom we are neglecting is &lt;strong&gt;freedom of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of time is the freedom to spend one’s time how they wish, whether this means working on whatever you want or spending more time with your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When freedom is discussed, the discussion generally pertains to freedom of speech, association, marriage, voting, business, etc, but rarely is freedom of time mentioned. Maybe it’s because our country was founded by slaveowners who had unlimited free time, or the cultural legacy of the Protestant work ethic. But regardless of your political stance, freedom of time is something that we should strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuting to and working a job one doesn’t find meaningful or enjoy but feels obligated to undergo due to lacking any other alternative is not real freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Economic Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, &lt;strong&gt;freedom can be maximized by maximizing wealth and income relative to cost of living.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom metric: (Wealth + Income) / Cost of Living&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So freedom can be maximized by increasing wealth and/or income, and by reducing cost of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing Wealth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Worth = Assets - Debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is a function of saving and inheritence, and thus a byproduct of income relative to cost of living. I include it because one doesn’t need to have an income to be free (eg. the retired, trust fund kids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can have a lot of assets negated by having a lot of debt (eg. mortgage, auto loan, student loans). Debt as a result of cost of living should be minimized. Interest payments are a drain on real income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./FRED_graph_of_US_labor_share_1948%E2%80%932016.svg&quot; alt=&quot;labor share of income&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor’s share of national income has declined since the 1970s. Since most people make income from labor, this is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost of Living&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income is meaningless without factoring in cost of living. Reducing the cost of living needs to be given higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost of living is largely comprised of housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of housing has skyrocketed, and it’s not because the quality of homes have skyrocketed. 100 year old tenement buildings in NYC have gotten incredibly expensive because there’s a housing shortage - created mostly by zoning restrictions that prevent new modest housing developments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher education and healthcare in the U.S. is exorbitantly expensive, should be considered an international embarrassment, and need to be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Consumer Goods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to own and use things such as a laptop and software could be considered a freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not proposing that we mandate prices on laptops or software to force them to be accessible. I’m simply stating that increasing accessibility via lowering prices is a desirable outcome that should be strived for, and it’s a natural byproduct of technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political freedom is another freedom that is severely lacking. It’s true that every citizen now has the right to vote, but despite this the citizenry don’t feel represented by their government. This is endemic of a broken outdated system of governance that needs to be modernized (more on that in the “Modernize Democracy” section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technological Advancement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s much disputement that technological advancement is good - whether that take the form of faster computers, renewable energy, better medicine, AI, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention it because I don’t think it gets enough priority when it comes to policy. &lt;strong&gt;Technological advancement reduces cost of living and improves our standard of living.&lt;/strong&gt; Automation means less people have to work, freeing their time up to do other things. Much of the drudgery of household work (eg. washing machines), farming (combine harvesters), and factory work have been automated away. Soon self-driving cars will make truck driving, taxi driving, and delivery (with the help of drones) obsolete. This is something that should be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is that under our current economic system, automation - rather than being something that’s unequivocally positive - is feared because it deprives those whose jobs are lost of their livelihoods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a severe systemic flaw that discourages technological advancement. This can be remedied via an improved safety net, universal basic income, job guarantee program, or fundamental restructuring of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on distribution and accessibility instead of just mean/median&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with GDP/capita and unemployment rate is that they are mean/median statistics, and thus say nothing of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar, the average person there is a millionaire (or even a billionaire), but that says nothing about the financial situation of the customers and bar workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of fixating solely on means/medians, we should be looking at distributions. If the median person is living well but 30% of the population is broke, depressed, and living paycheck to paycheck, then there is a severe problem there. If the median person has a home but 10% of the population is homeless, there is a severe problem (these aren’t real statistics, I’m just proving a point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./9684019_web1_L-Homeless-Tents-Los-Angeles-EDH-171207-1024x683@2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;homeless outside skyscrapers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than just maximizing means/medians, we should be maximizing the minimum. Instead of just maximizing the standard of living of the median person, how about ensuring that every person has access to shelter, food, healthcare, and education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modernize Democracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our democracy is fundamentally broken, and this doesn’t get enough attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative democracy was devised during a time when horseback was the primary means of transportation and direct democracy was technologically unfeasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now in an era where direct democracy on a mass scale is technologically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative democracy is prone to corruption and the principal-agent problem. Political parties are failing to represent the citizenry, catering instead to the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to modernize democracy, such as via an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f&quot;&gt;electronic democracy (aka liquid democracy)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom and technological advancement should be the primary objectives of economic and political policy. Freedom encompasses freedom of time, economic freedom, and political freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP and unemployment rate are horrible metrics that say nothing about standard of living and get way too much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median/mean statistics get way too much attention while distribution and accessibility don’t get enough. We should maximize the minimum rather than just maximizing the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy must be modernized via an electronic (liquid) democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not aware of any political party that’s advocating for these things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simple Living (Stop Feeding the Beast)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are the material possessions that I need to live a life that I’m content with:ShelterFoodLaptop with internet connectionCell phone with…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/simple-living/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/simple-living/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2018 14:12:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here are the material possessions that I need to live a life that I’m content with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop with internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone with internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything else is pure luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like the media constantly shoves products down our throats, making us feel like we need to buy this crap we don’t need to feel complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./1-UNCLE+SAM+-+CONSUME+-+THEY+LIVE+-+HAL+HEFNER.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CONSUME&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fulfillment via material possessions is at best temporary - your new car makes you happy for a week, and then you get used to it and that “hole” in your life is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to truly feel fulfilled is to get rid of this hole, to rid yourself of any dependency on external material possessions for your own internal happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most material purchases are for status signaling anyways (eg. expensive house/car, luxury handbag). I think it’s pretty self-explanatory that buying something just to impress other (shallow) people is absolutely pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean one must move into the countryside and become a monk or live like an Amish person, cutting themselves off from all modern technology. I love technology and the internet and would prefer to continue participating in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don’t need 99.999% of the sh!t that people want me to buy. I don’t need a penthouse suite in a big city, a fancy car, expensive clothes, and whatever other meaningless crap everyone is peddling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me a laptop and an internet connection and I’m good. I can access any book, article, video, TV show, song, or software ever made for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I used to stay at AirBnBs and hotels, but now I live in hostels because I prefer the social atmosphere. If I really wanted to save money and be free I could just sleep in a tent.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an inherent characteristic of capitalism. Short of government interference (redistribution of wealth, breaking monopolies), this is as mathematically certain as the fact that the limit of n as n approaches infinity is infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because &lt;strong&gt;the more money you have, the easier it is to make even more money&lt;/strong&gt; (eg. investments, passive income). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have $10m in an index fund that tracks the stock market, a conservative 4% annual return means making $400k/year without doing any actual work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows by this premise alone that as time goes on, society will naturally trend towards ever-increasing concentration of wealth. Money naturally funnels up to the owner class, and the economy becomes catered to the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Businesses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applies not only to individuals/houses, but also to businesses. Businesses also trend towards increasing market concentration (ie. fewer and bigger firms) and eventually oligopoly/monopoly through merges and acquisitions. Again, government interference in breaking down monopolies is the only mechanism that would prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the case for nearly every sector of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example in 1978, 10 airlines accounted for 90% of domestic flights in the U.S. Today, 4 airlines account for 80%. The same pattern has also been witnessed in telecommunications, retail (eg. WalMart), ecommerce (Amazon), pharmaceuticals, finance, tech, marketing, agriculture, radio (iHeartRadio), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech industry, every new innovative startup seems to get acquired by Google (Android, Youtube, DeepMind, Nest, Firebase), Facebook (Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus), Microsoft (Skype, GitHub), Amazon (Audible, Twitch, Zappos, Imdb), or Apple (Shazam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side effect of increasing market concentration is that it increases bargaining power of the monopoly/oligopoly, creating monopsony over laborers and keeping down wages. Even the tech titans in Silicon Valley (Google, Apple, Intel, etc) have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation&quot;&gt;guilty of this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy people disproportionally own these businesses. 10% of the population owns 84% of the stock market, and private equity is inaccessible to investors without substantial money to invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is a symbiotic relationship between increasing monopoly/oligopoly and increasing wealth concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wealth concentrates and businesses consolidate, power is concentrated in a small ownership class. The economy becomes more and more catered to the wealthy while the rest are sidelined (eg. like homeless people who are invisible to the economy because serving them is unprofitable). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this is how every new residential building development in NYC is a luxury tower catered to millionaires/billionaires. There’s just more profit in serving people with a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Does Society Owe You Anything?]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Society doesn’t owe you anything.” This phrase is often said by people on the right-wing, usually to argue against redistribution of wealth…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/society-doesnt-owe-you-anything/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/society-doesnt-owe-you-anything/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Society doesn’t owe you anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase is often said by people on the right-wing, usually to argue against redistribution of wealth, universal healthcare, public education, and anything resembling a government handout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if society doesn’t owe you anything, then &lt;strong&gt;it follows that society literally owes you absolutely nothing&lt;/strong&gt;, including enforcement of any laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone steals your property, then society doesn’t owe you any help in catching the criminal, giving you back your stolen property, and punishing the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone physically harms you, then society doesn’t owe you any help in finding the criminal, punishing the criminal, and providing you any medical treatment you may need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly society would be pure chaos if there was no rule of law and enforcement of it. This is why we have what’s known as a social contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can negotiate on the terms of the contract, but unless you’re an advocate of pure anarchy, the phrase “society doesn’t owe you anything” is technically not something you truly stand by and thus not a legitimate retort to arguing against anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is Living?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I swam in a waterfall, drove through the countryside, and climbed up this mountain to just chill.

&lt;p&gt;In NYC I always felt like I constantly had to be doing something - work, making money, working on a side project, upgrading my skills, researching, learning, competing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many of us live in a permanent state of delayed gratification, losing the ability to just sit still and enjoy the present. That’s one thing I love about travel - it takes you out of your autopilot routine and forces you into the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As great as it is that capitalism has helped bring us all these fancy toys, I don’t think there’s any denying that western culture has become toxic. Mindless consumerism, every man for himself mentality, competing against each other in this ridiculous rat race. Our humanity has been stripped from us and replaced with mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell does it even mean to be human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the answer to that question. But I know what ISN’T human. Commuting an hour a day to some meaningless office job you hate is not living like a human, it’s living like a zoo animal. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I Made This Website]]></title><description><![CDATA[I made this website with Gatsby.js, a static website generator framework based on React.js.

The website is hosted for free via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namecheap.com/&quot;&gt;NameCheap&lt;/a&gt; for the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even get into this - for the 99% of you out there who just want to make a standard website, just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wix.com/&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt;, or one of the countless other website generator tools or CMS frameworks that don’t require you to be a software engineer to build and maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I went with a static website vs. running a server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Easier to build and maintain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My older personal websites used to have dynamic servers running Node.js on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; with Nginx, Redix, React, Redux, etc. It’s great for learning, but (1) it takes a ton of time to build (2) frameworks get outdated quickly, meaning there’s a good chance your code will be obsolete in 6 months (3) maintenance takes too much time. Ultimately every hour you have to devote to maintaining your codebase and servers is time you’re unable to devote to creating content for your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most websites don’t need dynamic servers, and static websites are way easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting on GitHub Pages means I don’t pay a cent to host my website. It’s 100% free. I no longer have to pay a monthly AWS bill for an EC2 instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Faster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static websites are more performant and scale easier than websites with dynamic servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Blog posts in Markdown format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok I could’ve done this with a dynamic server as well, but having a static website forced me to create a markdown file for each post. There’s significant value in having each post in the same format because then I can easily migrate my site to another framework down the line if I need to with little hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gatsby vs. Jekyll vs. Hugo vs. Hexo vs. Next.js&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Gatsby or Next.js mostly because (1) it’s blazingly fast since it’s a single-page app (2) I’m already very familiar with the React.js ecosystem having worked professionally with React for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is a static site generator whereas Next.js is a full-stack Node/React-based framework that happens to generate static files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with Gatsby because it already does what I need out of the box, whereas Next.js would’ve required a lot more work to get everything setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How has it worked out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely been a lot of work because there are very few themes, and they’re all super basic. If you’re content with one of the basic themes, then great - you don’t have to do any coding. But if you want something more custom, then you’ll have to know how to code with React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve overall been very impressed. The setup is super straightforward and easy to hit the ground running. Implementing Google Analytics was as easy as adding my tracking code to the constructor of a plugin called “gatsby-plugin-google-analytics” that’s already included with the template. I’ve wanted to see what GraphQL was all about and this has been a good excuse to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint other than the lack of templates requiring me to be a developer again is that the build time is a bit slow. Also when I’m in dev mode and add in a new post, I see the post on the homepage but can’t load the post without restarting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall there’s still a lot of work to do. I want a sidebar, related articles at the end of each article, Disqus integration, search, tagging (started this but not complete yet), etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this requires being a developer or hiring one. Thus if you’re not a developer, you should just use one of the solutions I recommended in the intro that doesn’t require you to touch any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, all that matters is your content and that you have a functional website that can easily be maintained. Nobody cares about your tech stack except for engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;06/28/19 UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Wasted 3 hours trying to figure out why my site wouldn’t build anymore. Was getting a cryptic error, and Googling wasn’t returning anything. Turned out there was an issue with one of the photos in one of my older blog posts from a year ago - strange because it worked fine before, and it’s not clear why that one single image has a problem but not the other pictures in the same post taken by the same cell phone. I compressed the image and now it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I’ll reiterate - if you’re not a software engineer and/or don’t want to waste time maintaing your site, then just use something like WordPress or Squarespace!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to work an office job without destroying your eyes, wrists, and back]]></title><description><![CDATA[It probably won’t come as a surprise to you that sitting down all day and staring at a bright LED screen a couple feet away from your…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/programmer-health/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/programmer-health/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:18:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It probably won’t come as a surprise to you that sitting down all day and staring at a bright LED screen a couple feet away from your eyeballs while repeating the same hand motions over and over again for 8 hours a day isn’t great for your health.

&lt;p&gt;The younger people here are probably rolling their eyes: “I’ve been doing this my whole life and I’m fine, what difference does it make?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing this every day, you will inevitably be crippled by this, and way sooner than you think. It didn’t even take me a year of working full-time to start feeling the symptions enough to where I knew something had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend taking these precautions as soon as possible in order to delay the inevitable crippling of your body (unless of course you want to have unbearable eye strain, need glasses, a bad back, and carpal tunnel syndrome, in which case you should stop reading this article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Themes / Night-Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always use dark themes / night-mode. Avoid staring at bright screens (eg. white background with black text).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White text on a black background is far better for your eyes than black text on a white background. This is why code editors these days almost always default to a dark theme (sadly that didn’t use to be the case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en&quot;&gt;“Dark Reader” Chrome plugin&lt;/a&gt; to make any website dark. I set the plugin up so that it doesn’t modify the look of any new website until I tell it to (CTRL+SHIFT+A). It works on 90% of websites without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course your code editors should always be dark. If they’re not, then you will inevitably be forced to make them dark when your vision deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I had to do not because everything being dark makes me look like a 1337 hacker, but because the eye strain became so unbearable that I was forced to find another solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f.lux / SunsetScreen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These programs help reduce eye strain by reducing blue light. They make a massive difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://justgetflux.com/&quot;&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular, but I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skytopia.com/software/sunsetscreen&quot;&gt;SunsetScreen&lt;/a&gt; for Windows because you can toggle it on/off instantly without that annoyingly long transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look away from the monitor as often as possible, ideally focusing on distant objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re sitting there in deep thought, get in the habit of looking away from the monitor. It’s also good to focus on distant objects (eg. looking out the window) every now and then in order to prevent nearsightedness and eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re at it, stretch and massage your wrist/hands/back (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laptop Stand / Monitor at eye level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laptops are absolutely terrible for your back, and if you don’t feel the pain now you most certainly will eventually if you use them long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that the monitor is too low, forcing you to hunch over, which is terrible for your back and posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you want the monitor to be at eye level. This can be accomplished via purchasing a laptop stand and using an external keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Roost-Laptop-Stand-Adjustable-Portable/dp/B01C9KG8IG&quot;&gt;Roost Laptop Stand ($75)&lt;/a&gt;, but you can find cheap portable laptop stands on Amazon for $20 and I think they’re just as good as this one. Just make sure they fold up so that it doesn’t take much room in your backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Wired-Keyboard-Mouse-Bundle/dp/B00B7GV802&quot;&gt;cheap wired USB keyboard ($14)&lt;/a&gt;. No complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a computer monitor, make sure it’s at eye level. If it’s not, then get a monitor stand or place it on top of some big books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put the monitor as far away as possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people sit way too close to their monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a high-resolution monitor (4k is great)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I’ll sound spoiled, but I can’t look at 1080p monitors anymore for extended amounts of time without feeling the eye strain. Even my 2015 Macbook Pro was starting to strain my eyes (I don’t feel this on newer Macbook Pros or my Dell XPS 15 laptop with its 4k screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher resolution monitors are better for your eyesight. Don’t be shy about asking your company for a higher resolution monitor. 4K monitors are relatively expensive, but your eyes will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ergonomic Mouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to get a mouse that actually fits your hand, not one of those tiny carpal-tunnel inducing mouses that for whatever reason seem to be the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-300&quot;&gt;Steelseries Rival 300&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not a gamer, it was just the only comfortable mouse I could find that fits my standard adult male sized hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-Graphite/dp/B071YZJ1G1&quot;&gt;Logitech MX Master&lt;/a&gt; is a popular choice, but I personally prefer the default thumb position resting on the forward/back buttons rather than the (unclickable) horizontal scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust your chair height to make sure you’re at the optimal level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience most office desks are too low, requiring me to lower my chair height significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first company had desks that were too low, requiring me to lower my chair height so much that my legs weren’t at a comfortable height. If you’re designing an office, please don’t make the same mistake that company made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a standing desk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stretch and massage your wrists/hands periodically, as well as your back/shoulders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do this every opportunity I get, and it makes a big difference in reducing carpal tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to rotate my wrists such that my palms are facing up, bend my hands backwards towards the floor, and hold. It seems to counter the position that typing and holding a mouse forces your hands into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting down all day is bad for you. You should be doing cardio and lifting weights regardless, but even moreso if you have a sedentary office job where you’re about as active as a vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not feel the symptoms now, but if you’re spending a significant amount of time in front of the computer (eg. 40+ hours/week) without taking any precautions, I promise you that you will inevitably feel the symptoms of eye strain, carpal tunnel, and a back back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking these precautions might not make you immune, but they will drastically help in delaying what would otherwise be inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social Skills as a Software Engineer]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was grabbing lunch with a stockbroker friend of mine from the hostel the other day, and for fun we decided to shoot some street interviews…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/programmer-social-skills/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/programmer-social-skills/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 12:17:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was grabbing lunch with a stockbroker friend of mine from the hostel the other day, and for fun we decided to shoot some street interviews with him being the interviewer and me filming. Despite English not being his native language, he spoke very well, had a very authoritative presence, and did an excellent job. When the first subject didn’t want to be filmed, he did a great job attempting to convince her by trying to make her think that this was in her best interest, taking the interaction way further than I would’ve. Ultimately she declined the interview, but I could tell that he would make a great salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed with how effortless it was from the first attempt. Then I remembered that his job as a stockbroker is basically to be on the phone all day selling investments to clients, often high net-worth individuals. Of course he’s a good salesman, that’s his freaking job and his paycheck depends on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this reminded me why I bought a camera and started traveling in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Importance of Social Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social skills are paramount to networking and selling, which are fundamental to running a business and making money. I used to see socializing as something that should always come naturally and not require work or compromising “yourself” (whatever the “self” is) in any way, but over the past year my thoughts on this have completely changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I see immense value in being able to connect with people of all types beyond who you would just happen to connect with naturally. By developing the skills, experiences, and general desire to connect with more people, you open yourself to vastly more opportunities - whether that be a potential business partner, investment opportunity, mentor, friend, romantic interest, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalities differ drastically, and it’s useful to be able to connect with as many of them as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have many regrets in life, but I do regret some of the bridges I’ve burned (mostly from ex-roommates) by sticking to my principles in disagreements when in hindsight I should not have allowed a relatively minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things sabotage the entire relationship. Unless we’re talking about something very serious (eg. tens of thousands of dollars), it’s probably better to just bite the bullet in the short-term to retain that connection in the long run. This need not make you a pushover, it’s just pragamatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the biggest downsides of being a software engineer is that it’s not a job conducive to developing social skills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You stare at a computer all day typing code into a code editor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most software engineers are introverts. I can’t think of a single profession with as high of a rate of socially awkward nerds and geeks as computer science. This is because the type of people who enter and excel in this field are the type who are content staying home all day tinkering with their computers rather than going out and socializing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is less value in relationships and “who you know” compared to most other industries (eg. business, investing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Male-dominated. In most of my computer science courses there were at most one or two women in each class. This certainly does not help foster better social skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are software engineers who are very social so I don’t mean to suggest that it’s impossible to be social if you’re a software engineer. But if social skills don’t come naturally to you - the case for many software engineers - it’ll take conscious effort to develop these skills. And of course social skills will benefit any software engineer in their career, even if not to the same extent as a stockbroker or salesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does one go about developing social skills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a topic for its own post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I will say that the biggest thing has to do with mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to an event, party, the office kitchen, check-in to a hostel, etc and see a stranger, do you say “hi” or wait for them to say “hi” first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you take the lead, or wait for other people to lead you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be proactive, and you will create the results you want. Be passive, and your results will be at the whim of those who decide to take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I Sold My Macbook Pro for a Dell XPS 15]]></title><description><![CDATA[After 3 years exclusively using the Macbook Pro, I’ve ditched it for the Dell XPS 15.As a web developer, the one thing that’d kept me on the…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-i-sold-my-macbook-pro-for-dell-xps-15/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-i-sold-my-macbook-pro-for-dell-xps-15/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2018 23:23:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After 3 years exclusively using the Macbook Pro, I’ve ditched it for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9570-laptop&quot;&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;As a web developer, the one thing that’d kept me on the Macbook Pro (aside from the fact that it was always my assigned work laptop) was OSX’s Unix-based operating system along with its widespread support for commercial software (eg. Adobe) which Linux unfortunately lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq&quot;&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve got a Unix shell on Windows. It’s slow and can’t do everything yet, but it’s good enough to where it’s no longer an automatic disqualifier against using Windows for a software engineer not working on the Windows stack (eg. .NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I Hate the New Macbook Pro&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Apple has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=savh-fYCsz0&quot;&gt;sabotaged its Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replacing the top row of keys with a touchbar (removing the Esc button, F1-10 keys, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate the touchbar. I use the Escape key a lot, and replacing it with a long touch bar reduces my productivity, plain and simple. When you tap the touchpad, there is absolutely no feedback, so when I press where the former Escape key is, it seems that half the time it doesn’t even register. And I don’t even use Vim that much (code editor that makes heavy use of the Esc key) - if I did then this alone would make this laptop a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replacing its formerly top-notch keyboard with an extremely uncomfortable “butterfly keyboard”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Macbook Pro had one of the best keyboards I’ve ever seen on a laptop. The new Macbook Pro’s keyboard is extremely uncomfortable. The keys that were once cushiony are now hard and thin, with little “give” when you press them. After typing for long periods of time I found it very uncomfortable on my finger tips. After a month of use I still did not get used to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing all USB ports and the SD card slot, requiring expensive dongles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you need a dongle for anything that’s not USB-C. The dongles are annoying and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to use a wireless mouse, I just haven’t found anything as comfortable as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Rival-Optical-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00FAN4M3S&quot;&gt;Steelseries Rival Optical Mouse&lt;/a&gt; (it was $60 before, not sure why the price skyrocketed, maybe from my advertising?) that’s designed for adult human hands rather than tiny midget hands inducing carpel tunnel syndrome. Unfortunately this mouse is USB (not USB-C), and thus requires a dongle. Same with external hard drives, and the SD cards to my cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing inferior AMD graphics cards, and being behind the curve specs-wise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Adobe products like Premiere for video editing, do 3d modeling (eg. with Blender), or anything computationally intensive that utilizes the graphics card like deep learning, then you will be at a severe performance disadvantage using the AMD card. I posted some benchmarks rendering videos in Premiere and 3D animations in Blender in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHY9tPNJM94%5D&quot;&gt;MBP vs. Dell XPS 15 video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If however you are using Apple’s Final Cut Pro for video editing, that software is optimized for Mac and AMD so you’ll be better off on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending $1,000 more for a similar machine might be questionable, but spending that much more for an inferior machine is just plain stupid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you’re a student and/or aspiring software engineer, then the Macbook Pro might still be the safer choice because your work laptop will most likely be a Mac if you’re working in the U.S. (on a non-Microsoft stack).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be fair if you’re always using an external keyboard and basically just using the laptop like a desktop, then the laptop keyboard is not as big of a deal. And there are massive differences between OSX and Windows/Linux as your operating system, so comparing a Mac to a Windows machine is not an Apples to Apples comparison (no pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at other aspects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other aspects of Dell XPS 15 vs. Macbook Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touchpad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple still has the best touchpad, no question about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Dell’s touchbar isn’t actually that terrible. You can customize it to have basically the same functionality (two-finger click for right-click). Either way, I personally always use a mouse because I hate touchbars in general and find them carpel-tunnel inducing, so this doesn’t really affect me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound quality on the Macbook Pro is clearly superior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dell XPS 15 has a 4k screen, so resolution wise it is superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don’t think the difference is really noticeable (to be fair I haven’t done a side-by-side comparison) because the Macbook’s screen is pretty damn good as well. The Macbook’s screen is narrower but taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell XPS 15’s 4k screen is touch screen, but I never use that so it doesn’t make a difference to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way better on the Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macbook Pro is lighter and thinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also one thing I’ve noticed about the Dell XPS 15 that I absolutely hate is that when I’m charging it, there seems to be an electric current running through the surface of the laptop that can’t be healthy. I didn’t even notice until my girlfriend who was touching my left arm noticed it was vibrating when I rested it on the laptop. This is absolutely unacceptable. I don’t believe this happened on the Macbook (though I sold it a while ago so can’t confirm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 months or so into owning my Dell XPS 15, the bottom 15% of the screen just died. I was abroad and my U.S. warranty didn’t conver me abroad. After wasting a lot of time playing phone tag with clueless customer support agents, I finally learned that I could just purchase international warranty ($260) and walk into any Dell customer service center to get it fixed. Only took a couple days to get it fixed in Ho Chi Minh City. It’s been 6 months since then and I haven’t had any more issues since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a problem where the laptop would overheat in my backpack with the fan blasting at full throttle despite the lid being closed for 3+ hours. I haven’t experienced this problem in 4 months now though so I think it was finally fixed in a firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t own the new Macbook long enough to say whether there were reliability problems. I’ve never had problems with my other Macbooks, but my refurbished 2015 Macbook Pro had a couple issues - one with the graphics card when I first bought it where the screen would go crazy once per day, and a dead pixel 4 months in. Luckily both of these were covered under the 1-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Macbook’s build advantages, overall I find the Dell XPS 15 to be more performant for my needs and a significantly better value. I’m so dissatisfied with the Macbook Pro’s touchbar and uncomfortable keyboard that I refuse to purchase a Macbook Pro until they fix them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/04/kuo-new-keyboard-macbook-air-pro/&quot;&gt;July 4th, 2019 update: looks like they’re finally getting rid of the butterfly keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. I hate the way they implemented the touchbar, but if they really insisted on a touchbar then perhaps it might be acceptable if they placed it above the Escape key row, retained the Escape key, or added some kind of feedback mechanism to pressing it (eg. it being pressable like a button, a vibration like any smartphone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to get a Dell XPS 15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No stupid touchbar (death if you’re a vim user), no lack of USB ports and SD card slot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000 cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More performant for most applications due to NVIDIA graphics card and better specs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to get a Macbook Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard in software engineering in the U.S. (unless you’re on the Microsoft stack, doing deep learning on your laptop, game development / 3d graphics, and other niches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sketch software is Mac-only (popular right now, but there are alternatives like Figma with cross-OS support)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better Unix support. Windows Subsystem for Linux is objectively inferior to the command line on OSX. Of course you could install Linux on the Dell, but then you’re potentially switching between two operating systems which is more of a hassle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote this article, Apple released a new Macbook Pro with better specs. But it’s still got that awful touchbar.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Completing things is addicting]]></title><description><![CDATA[I wasn’t planning to write so much today.

&lt;p&gt;I was 100% guilty of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite spending hundreds, maybe thousands of hours producing electronic music in high school and college, I never actually really completed anything or had anything to show for it other than hundreds of unfinished projects. I could show you a ton of sick 4-16 bar loops, but not a completed song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been putting off videomaking for a long time because the videos I make have to be perfect. I’ve been meaning to make videos like “How to become a software engineer without a CS degree” and “How to go from $70k/yr to $140k/yr salary in 2 years” and “The story of my life” and “Which camera should I get for video?” for years now, but I never made them because they just have to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been putting off writing and making a real website to host my writing for months now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that nothing is perfect, and no work of art is every truly complete. At some point we just reach the point of diminishing returns and choose to stop working on it and start working on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote 6 articles today. I dreaded writing the first articles because I didn’t feel like I was in the right headspace to be able to write them to the standard of quality that I deem adequate. I haven’t written or read a book in forever, and I don’t feel articulate at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I forced myself to write them anyways, and feel much better after having done so because I no longer feel like the lazy unproductive decaying piece of sh!t that I felt like before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they amazing articles that I’m completely satisfied with? No. But it’s a start, and I can always edit them later. Right now lack of quality isn’t my biggest bottleneck or most pressing need, I need to make my damn website and get in the habit of writing and getting stuff done again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 half-assed articles beats 6 perfect ideas trapped in your head that nobody will ever see.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reactive Dopamine-Addicted State]]></title><description><![CDATA[Reactive State: The dopamine-addicted state of living in pure reaction.The Reactive State is what I call that dopamine-addicted zombie-like…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/reactive-dopamine-state/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/reactive-dopamine-state/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 17:29:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive State: The dopamine-addicted state of living in pure reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Reactive State&lt;/strong&gt; is what I call that dopamine-addicted zombie-like state where you’re &lt;strong&gt;living in reaction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might manifest itself in constantly (or even desperately) checking your phone for DM notifications, mindlessly scrolling through your Facebook/Instagram/Reddit feed, and being preoccupied with what other people think about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than creating your own reality and carving your own path through life, you’re living in reaction to other peoples’ reality. You’re living on the sidelines, waiting for somebody better than you to invite you into their lives and fix all of your problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an awful state to be in, and there is absolutely no benefit to being in this state. Everyone should strive to eliminate any resemblance of this state from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You are a product of your habits]]></title><description><![CDATA[You are a product of your habits.Our brains are naturally lazy and seek what’s easy, the past of least resistance - the comfort zone.It’s…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/habits/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/habits/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 17:24:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You are a product of your habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains are naturally lazy and seek what’s easy, the past of least resistance - the comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s harder to change a habit than it is to change your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore if you have the right habits in place, then achieving your goals will be as inevitable as the fact that a pilot on autopilot will inevitably reach his/her destination (barring any unforeseeable emergencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your brain’s laziness to its advantage and develop the right habits most conducive to your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of this is developing a productive &lt;a href=&quot;/ideal-work-schedule&quot;&gt;daily routine&lt;/a&gt;. With the right routine, your life is essentially automated towards whatever your routine optimizes for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out the routine that’s optimal for you in bringing you to your goals, and implement it. Eventually it’ll become a habit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it will be harder for you to not reach your goals than it will be for you to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Communal Living]]></title><description><![CDATA[I think that communal living is the ideal way to live for anyone not in a serious committed relationship.I’ve spent the last 8 months living…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/communal-living/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/communal-living/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 16:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I think that communal living is the ideal way to live for anyone not in a serious committed relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last 8 months living in hostels, hotels, and AirBnBs, and have come to the conclusion that hostels are the best - both for happiness and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotels and renting out your own apartment on AirBnB are lonely and boring - even when you have friends. Unless there’s a good reason you need your own place, I don’t see the point - especially since it’s more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hostels you meet a ton of people. Some of these people have changed my life, even if only in a small way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you don’t connect with anyone, having people around seems to have a more positive effect on my mental health, which in turn makes me more productive. It’s why working in a coffee shop in the viscinity of other people is often significantly more productive than working alone in your bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who when living alone tends to stray into a nocturnal lifestyle, hostels also help me keep a more sane sleep schedule. It’s easier to wake up at a more reasonable time when everybody else in your dorm is waking up at 9am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private rooms in decent hostels are unfortunately always very expensive than hotel rooms and 1 bedroom apartments on AirBnB, but I actually don’t mind dorm rooms and find that the positives of being in the communal environment far outweigh the negatives. The only problem with dorm rooms is when 1. the room is uncomfortable (can be avoided by finding a quality hostel or a better room in the hostel) 2. your hostelmate(s) snore and/or smell bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loud snorers are unfortunately way too prevalent. But this can be remedied by staying in rooms with less people (4 beds or less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the ideal amount of time to stay in one hostel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not really sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re very productive, then it might not make sense to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if your productivity is less than ideal or you’re in a rut, then there’s a good chance you’ll benefit by moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we’re so caught up in the weeds (local maxima) that it’s hard to see the forest for the trees. We might be stuck in a suboptimal maxima and not even realize it. That’s why I think that moving regularly is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to leave my last hostel after staying there for a week, but I had to because it was fully booked. But I’m now extremely grateful that I had to leave because it turns out that this next hostel is actually better than the last one for me to get work done. Though to be fair, if the hostel was a downgrade then I probably wouldn’t have been better off switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ideal Work Schedule]]></title><description><![CDATA[We all have our own conception of the ideal work schedule.

Some like to work out first thing in the morning, others like to meditate and do yoga, others like to go to co-working spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:45:&lt;/strong&gt; Wake up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:45-10:00&lt;/strong&gt; Gain consciousness. Maybe a light snack. Avoid checking phone or going on unproductive time sucks like Facebook/Instagram, though Hacker News, a good intellectual subreddit is fine, or the (non-sensationalized) news is fine (I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:00-12:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00-13:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Lunch. At this point I leave the apartment and walk outside to get food somewhere. If I were cooking for myself that’d be fine too, but I think it’s important to leave the house for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13:00-17:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17:00-18:30:&lt;/strong&gt; Gym + Shower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18:30-19:30:&lt;/strong&gt; Dinner, preferably with friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19:30-01:00:&lt;/strong&gt; Do whatever you want. Now is the time to respond to all those messages and talk with your friends, hang out, do something random, or even work if you feel inspired. This drowsy state is actually a great time to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:00-1:45:&lt;/strong&gt; Get ready to go to sleep. Reading a book is ideal, but I’m pretty awful at doing that lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doesn’t need to be a Nazi about being on schedule, but having some semblance of a routine is important for being productive. The reason is because we are a &lt;a href=&quot;/habits&quot;&gt;product of our habits&lt;/a&gt;. The less energy you have to consciously devote to wasteful questions like “what should I do next?”, the more energy you can devote to getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things is to start your morning off on the right foot, because your morning sets the tone for the rest of your day. I recommend avoiding checking your phone, messaging apps, and social media in the morning because it can distract you and pull you down into that unproductive &lt;a href=&quot;/reactive-dopamine-state&quot;&gt;reactive dopamine-addicted state&lt;/a&gt;. Once you fall down that hole it’s &lt;a href=&quot;/habits&quot;&gt;hard to climb out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning is also when most people are at full mental capacity to get work done. Don’t waste this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that the morning seems to be the best time to knock out logical tasks that are most “unpleasant” (eg. coding something difficult but not fun), whereas later afternoon is better for more creative tasks that are enjoyable (eg. writing). I’m still forming my thoughts on this though, so don’t take it as gospel. Will update as I update my views.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Foreigner's Impression of NYC]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was just speaking to a South African in the hostel common area who’d spent 8 years living in London.

When I told him I’d been living in NYC, his reaction was “oh wow. I don’t know how anyone lives there, it’s too much ‘city’ for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually seems to be the most common reaction I get when I’m abroad. And after leaving NYC and seeing many other cities, I can see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYC, particularly Manhattan, is truly unique among major developed cities in how dense and congested it is. But unlike a city like Tokyo which is also dense but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCU2OkSVHWU&quot;&gt;feels comfortable&lt;/a&gt;, Manhattan just feels overcrowded. The South African hit the nail on the head when he called out the nonstop ear-piercing police/ambulance sirens, one of my least favorite parts of the city (there’s a dead simple solution to fixing this problem: &lt;em&gt;turn the f*cking volume down&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my world tour thinking I’d analyze all of these world cities and compare them to NYC, but I realized early on that NYC is so unique in its overcongestedness. Compared to NYC, virtually every city feels relatively comfortable (except for somewhere like New Delhi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that most companies have offices in Manhattan, and so living in the outer boroughs means you’ll have to spend 20-60 minutes commuting to Manhattan. Under a typical 9am-5pm work Monday-Friday, this means you’ll be spending the bulk of your day in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure if you can work from home then you can live in any borough, but if you can work from anywhere why on earth would you choose to live in a city as expensive as NYC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course NYC has a lot of other positives that may overtake the negatives and make it worth living in for a couple years. But I think the overcongestedness and high cost of living disqualifies it as a comfortable place to live in long-term.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cold Weather]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s cold outside here in Kiev (13° high, 7° low).

As someone who hates cold weather, this would normally be my cue to leave - after all that’s why I left Argentina in June despite enjoying myself so much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m still here, and oddly enough I’m actually enjoying this sudden chilly weather (though I would’ve preferred a more gradual cooling rather than going straight from summer to winter in 2 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hint of cold after a hot sunny summer is something that we dread because it signals the end of summer. But when it actually starts getting cold and you get past the whole “end of summer” dread, it’s actually fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I feel is nostalgia. I felt nostalgia for my time in Buenos Aires 3 months prior - walking through an epic cemetary with my local “friend”, wandering around the city cluelessly with some hostel friends, chatting with my hilarious South African dormmate on the balcony at 7am after a long night out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt nostalgia for NYC - walking through a park with a friend and watching the leaves change color and fall down. I’m always transported back to Morningside Heights in 2012 - my first time moving to NYC to start graduate school at Columbia University. I remember that feeling of excitement - of finally being in the big city I’d longed to live in since my internship the prior summer, of attending an Ivy League school, of the world being my oyster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course the memory tends to be better than the reality, but I won’t let that prevent me from basking in the nostalgia.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an ocean of nostalgia, cold weather signifies change. It’s a goodbye to the carefree days of running around outside and laying on the beach without any agenda, a return to getting back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that it’s way easier to be productive in cold weather than it is in hot tropical weather. In hot weather there is just way too many distractions. Without air conditioning, I’d probably be incapable of getting anything done in hot weather without what would seem to be a herculean level of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before beginning my 8 month world travel in the middle of winter in NYC, I was fed up with cold weather. “Escaping winter” was one of the main themes of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I appreciate cold weather, if only because it makes it a hell of a lot easier for me to justify to myself staying inside and getting some work done. But more than that, I appreciate the variation, as it signals change. And of course it’s easy to lose appreciation of warm weather without the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’m not sure if I’m ready to endure the entirety of a brutal European winter. But a month or two I can probably handle before I run off to somewhere warmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, weather is just weather. One should not be dependent on external circumstances for internal happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I'm still in Kiev]]></title><description><![CDATA[I arrived in Kiev on 8/17, and as I write this (9/26) I’m still here. Why did I stay in Kiev for over a month?After 4 months of travel in…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-in-kiev/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-in-kiev/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 23:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Kiev on 8/17, and as I write this (9/26) I’m still here. Why did I stay in Kiev for over a month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 4 months of travel in South America and 1.5 months of travel in Europe, I was exhausted of changing cities/countries all the time. It’s fun at first, but the novelty eventually fades, and it’s impossible to sit down and get anything productive done without something resembling a routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine was perfect not only because I was there at a time when I wanted to settle down, but also because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s cheap. It’s one of the cheapest countries in Europe - prices being on par with and sometimes cheaper than countries in South America and Southeast Asia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good infrastructure / High standard of living. Despite the low costs, infrastructure is basically on par with any western city. Mobile internet is very fast (I’m getting 7mbps), there’s public transportation, Taxify/Uber, etc. You can do practically anything you’d be able to do in a western city, just at a fraction of the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not in the Eurozone. Without EU citizenship, you can only stay in the entire Eurozone for 3 months over a 6 month period. So if I stayed in Poland for 3 months, I wouldn’t be allowed back in Europe for the next 3 months. If I stay in Ukraine, then it doesn’t count towards my stay in the Eurozone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not touristy. I prefer being in countries where there aren’t many tourists because it’s more interesting and I actually feel like I’m in a foreign country rather than feeling like I’m on a resort. I rarely hear anything other than Russian/Ukrainian here, and I prefer it that way. When I hear English on the streets, I feel like I might as well be in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting. The culture here is very different from in the west.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; The women…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are the people friendly?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question I’m often asked no matter where I am, and it’s a hard question for me to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought the people in eastern Europe weren’t friendly because the customer service people often don’t smile, thank you, or show any interest in serving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being here for a month, I’ve concluded that the people, especially younger people (under 40), are indeed very friendly, it’s just not as outwardly obvious because they don’t fake it with forced smiles and politeness. The people here are more real than in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re also curious about Americans. When I tell a Ukrainian I’m from the U.S. their initial reaction is often that of surprise, sometimes followed by “my dream is to move to the U.S.” and mention of how difficult it is for them to visit the U.S (the whole pricey application process is a scam in my opinion, but that’s a topic for another post). To be honest I don’t think I can recall any other country I’ve been where I’ve gotten this kind of curious positive reaction as often as I do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kiev vs. Lviv vs. Odessa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Ukraine there are three main cities visited by tourists: Kiev (population: 2.8m), Lviv (730k), and Odessa (1m). I visited all three and honestly could’ve stayed in any one of those cities and probably enjoyed myself. I just happened to make some friends in Kiev so I decided to stick it out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that Kiev is probably the best of the three to make a base though simply because it’s by far the largest, being the capital city. I’ve generally found it easier to make friends in larger cities vs. smaller cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well actually I do think that being too large can be a detriment in a way (eg. NYC), so maybe there is a happy medium somewhere, and Kiev seems to strike the perfect balance between being big enough to be interesting and cosmopolitan, yet not so big such that you feel like an expendable cog in a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much longer will I stay?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that it’s &lt;a href=&quot;/cold-weather&quot;&gt;getting cold&lt;/a&gt;, I might be heading out soon. But I’m in no rush to leave. I’ll play it week by week, and as soon as I’m satisfied with my work output, I’ll be on my way. But if it weren’t for the cold weather, I’d have no desire to leave. I really do like it here in Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to paint Kiev as some perfect city, it’s just a city and a country that I really want to get to know because it’s so damn different, and a country I could potentially see myself spending a lot of time in. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hostels are Amazing (1 week of hostel life in Kiev)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kiev, UkraineAfter spending a couple weeks in AirBnBs, I was bored and struggling to get work done, so I booked a dorm in a hostel for a…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/hostels/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/hostels/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kiev, Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a couple weeks in AirBnBs, I was bored and struggling to get work done, so I booked a dorm in a hostel for a couple days. I ended up extending my stay for another week. Not only did I meet many amazing people, but I was actually more productive. Hostels will now be my default residence of choice unless there’s a really good reason I need my own place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Checking in&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first checked into my 4-bed hostel, a French guy living in London and a Venezuelan living in Berlin were chatting. I joined the conversation, and ended up getting food and taking a long walk with the French guy. He had just arrived from Russia and told me how amazing it was there - how wild the nightlife was, and how beautiful the women were (he’s gay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about this particular hostel is that it’s attached to a trendy restaurant/cafe. Every morning I’d come here for breakfast, bring my laptop, and get some work done. I found myself way more focused and productive here than at home, I guess because I’m in the presence of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ukrainian Entrepreneur&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say this man changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was an entrepreneur in town for a couple days, working on a business idea that he was incredibly passionate about - not some “get rich quick scheme”, but something more meaningful that in his words “could save a life”. I gave him my honest feedback and encouragement, and then he asked me about what I was doing, following up with intelligent probing questions that really made me introspect about what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason I’ve struggled to tell people what I’m doing. I have a strong conviction in what I’m doing, but it felt weird telling people, and I didn’t know why. Talking to this man I realized that the reason I’d felt weird telling people was that for some reason I’d felt that if it didn’t involve “making money”, then people would think it’s stupid. This is not something I ever consciously thought about, which goes to show how far capitalism’s “profit motive” permeates our mind without us even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we were in many ways different - he was extremely well read, introverted but extremely good with people, very proactive - we shared a strong dissatisfaction with the inhumanity of modern society and the system, of robot zombies shuffling to their cubicle prisons like zoo animals, consumerism, society’s obsession with money, the fact that in our modern society we allow homeless people to (involuntarily) sleep on the streets and nobody cares because “it’s their fault” and “somebody else’s problem”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to him, I felt reinvigorated with my purpose again - something that was strong while I was working but had slowly faded away while traveling and avoiding real responsibilities. I remembered how important this is, and that this is way more important than money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was incredibly encouraging and gave me a ton of great ideas - both for articles and videos. I am forever grateful, and hope that one day I can repay the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of simply revitalizing my purpose, his unconventional perspective on a lot of things really opened up my mind. I can’t recall the last time I had a conversation as deep and enlightening in a hostel as the one I had with this man. The man was truly an intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally couldn’t sleep all night after being forced to switch into a hot mosquito-infested room, until at 7am or so somebody walked in with a spray and the mosquitos were all of a sudden gone. Luckily I was going to be switching into another room (I’d had to switch rooms every day because the hostel was almost fully booked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chernobyl Squad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next room would be the most fun. I chatted with the Malaysian woman living in Singapore staying in the bunk across from me on the first stop of a 2 month trip, and in came a Chilean living in Hamburg and a Polish tour guide. We all grabbed dinner and drinks, and ended up hanging out together the next couple days - walking, sightseeing, taking photos, drinking, and playing games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were all crazy, and that’s why we clicked so well. The Polish guy spoke like a comedian, The Chilean was always happy and making jokes, and the Malaysian also had a sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people I’ve met since graduating college and entering the “real world” tend to be pretty serious, but I’m naturally a very not serious person, so it’s refreshing to meet people who aren’t that I can joke around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chilean Guy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was always happy, positive, and cracking jokes. I think he’s the first Latin guy I’ve met since South America, and it really made me remember how different it is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d been living in Hamburg, Germany for the last year as a chef after working in the import/export business in Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me how the women there are like “robots”, valuing work above all else, being very risk-averse, and emotionless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One memorable story he told me was after he’d moved to Europe for a girl and they broke up after one month, he’d booked a hostel. In the hostel he met three other South American men who had quit their jobs and moved to Europe for a girl, only for the relationship to have ended. They realized they were fools for having done so, because these same women would not have done the same for them - quitting their jobs and moving to another continent for a man. The women would have never quit their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting him reminded me how different the culture really is between America and Europe. Europeans are generally more serious, logical, and educated, whereas South Americans tend to be more relaxed, carefree, and living in the present moment. On the same day there was a street festival here with a DJ and nobody was really dancing, whereas the same DJ in Brazil would have a giant crowd of people dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from the U.S. are like a hybrid between South Americans and Europeans, but more superficial, materialistic, and politically sensitive (obviously these are generalizations, the U.S. is extremely diverse so it’s impossible to put everyone in a bucket).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Am I Latin?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When foreigners meet me they’re often surprised that I’m from the U.S., telling me that I don’t seem like an American - especially one from NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently someone told me I’m like a Latin man. I think there’s some truth to this, but at the same time I’m definitely not completely there. I think I’m like a hybrid of Latin and European, with some American and Asian sprinkled in. Or something like that. But what do I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately everyone has since checked out, and the weather is getting colder. I will be moving to the next hostel because this hostel is fully booked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Story (short version)]]></title><description><![CDATA[I worked as a Full-Stack Web Engineer for 3 years in NYC - working my way up to Lead Engineer at an ecommerce company (resume) - before…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/my-story/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/my-story/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked as a Full-Stack Web Engineer for 3 years in NYC - working my way up to Lead Engineer at an ecommerce company (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com/resume.pdf&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;) - before leaving to &lt;a href=&quot;/places-ive-been&quot;&gt;travel the world&lt;/a&gt;. I started in South America, spent 4 months in Europe, and then moved to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been one to naturally question everything - starting in &lt;a href=&quot;/school-crime-humanity/&quot;&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; when I’d wonder why we were all forced to complete hours of busywork and &lt;a href=&quot;/lectures-suck/&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; this random stuff despite the fact that we’d forget most of it after the exam - to &lt;a href=&quot;/why-jobs-suck-perception-management&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; where I’d wonder why &lt;a href=&quot;/9-5-jobs/&quot;&gt;everyone has to sit there in the office for 8 hours&lt;/a&gt; if one can work &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-work-efficiently/&quot;&gt;twice as productively&lt;/a&gt; and finish everything in 4 while &lt;a href=&quot;/remote-work&quot;&gt;working from home&lt;/a&gt; and saving the hour-long roundtrip commute (hint: &lt;a href=&quot;/why-jobs-suck-perception-management/&quot;&gt;perception is everything&lt;/a&gt;). Or why we preach the superiority of democracy in our government, yet have no issues with oligarchy in our workplace. Or the fact that we must still work 40+ hour work weeks despite the fact that technology/automation has advanced to a point where it is not necessary to sustaining our standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people just accept things and move on. I’d imagine that’s what most Germans did during the Holocaust, or what most Americans did during slavery. To me it never felt like a morally defensible thing to idly stand by in the face of injustice. But since politics is taboo in today’s labor market, I understand why from a selfish perspective it makes more sense to keep silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is like a toned down version of the thoughts going on in my head. Until I’m financially independent enough to not have to care whether I’m employable, I’ll keep it “PG-13”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, I grew up always being the shyest kid in my class, but I hated being shy and did everything I could to overcome it. So naturally I have an interest in personal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have all the answers, but I’m documenting my thoughts here. Take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to hire me for remote work, you can find my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com/resume.pdf&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; and contact at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com&quot;&gt;jbernier.com&lt;/a&gt;, my personal website. I’m pretty good at coding in Javascript and building complex single-page web apps (built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vroom.com&quot;&gt;vroom.com&lt;/a&gt;, worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com&quot;&gt;iheart.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Credit Cards I Use and Recommend]]></title><description><![CDATA[Credit cards with cash back policies and no annual fees are essentially free money (assuming you treat it like a debit card and don’t spend…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/credit-cards/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/credit-cards/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Credit cards with cash back policies and no annual fees are essentially free money (assuming you treat it like a debit card and don’t spend more than you have) and give you greater security than debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily use two credit cards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International: &lt;strong&gt;Capital One QuickSilver (Visa).&lt;/strong&gt; 1.5% cash back, but no foreign transaction fee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. only: &lt;strong&gt;Citi Double Cash (Visa).&lt;/strong&gt; 2% cash back. 3% foreign transaction fee, so obviously I never use it abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively there’s the &lt;strong&gt;Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Card&lt;/strong&gt; (2% cash back, 1% foreign transaction fee) which I stopped using once I got the Citi Double Cash because 1. you can only redeem your cash when it’s greater than $50 (vs. $25 for Citi), 2. the cash must be redeemed into a Fidelity checking account (after which you can easily direct deposit it into your checking account of choice, it’s just additional hassle), and 3. I prefer Citi’s website/UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint with the Capital One card is that you can only redeem your cash rewards via credit or a check in the mail. Also I recently paid off my full balance a day before a scheduled autopay, but the autopay somehow still went through and right now I have a -$2,000 balance (that’s never happened to me on any other card), and the only way to get that back to $0 without me spending $2,000 is for them to mail me a check which takes something like 5-7 business days. Absurd that they haven’t adopted this amazing new cutting edge technology called “direct deposit” yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citi card has been fantastic. It’s too bad it has that steep foreign transaction fee, otherwise I’d use it for everything..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently got the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card from Chase&lt;/strong&gt;, but I only got that because I’m involved in some business making large purchases on Amazon and you get 5% cash back on Amazon purchases. If not for that and the fact that I’m getting Prime for free via a family plan, then I wouldn’t have bothered because I don’t otherwise spend much on Amazon. Lack of foreign transaction fees is nice though, and there’s 2% cash back on restaurants, drug stores, and gas stations. I’ll be putting that to use when I go abroad becuse that beats Capital One’s 1.5%. (edit: they closed my account without warning despite me keeping a near 0 balance, screw this card)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit cards often get a bad rep, but when used responsibily they essentially give you free money. On top of that, they’re safer than debit cards because you get greater fraud protection. If someone fraudulently withdraws money from your checking account, you’re going to have a much tougher time retrieving that money versus a credit card company who can easily reverse that transaction. Of course there’s also the benefit of building your credit history which will help with renting an apartment, getting a mortgage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably better credit cards out there that I’m not even aware of (or qualified for). Let me know if there are any others I should consider.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[International Mobile Plans]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s important to set up your mobile plan/strategy before leaving the country, especially if you’re currently with an overpriced provider…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/international-mobile-plans/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/international-mobile-plans/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s important to set up your mobile plan/strategy before leaving the country, especially if you’re currently with an overpriced provider like AT&amp;#x26;T because otherwise you’ll end up with a $623 cell phone bill over two months like I did (and that was with me trying to conserve data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BRua3snPqvztHaKa4m15UJ8HhOiX539XMSXLSMGd0qs/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;International Mobile Plans (Google Sheet)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two options (or a combination of the two):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for a U.S. coverage provider with a competitive international roaming plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy local SIM cards in the countries you’re visiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that to use foreign SIM cards, you’ll need to get your phone unlocked. You can do this by calling your cell phone coverage provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying SIM cards will get you the cheapest rates and fastest speeds, but you’ll have to deal with the additional hassle of purchasing a SIM card and recharging it when you run out of data. But if you’re staying in countries for longer periods of time, this is going to be the best option (especially in cheaper countries where the price savings are greater).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a Google Sheet I made of all the U.S. mobile plans worth considering: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BRua3snPqvztHaKa4m15UJ8HhOiX539XMSXLSMGd0qs/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;International Mobile Plans (Google Sheet)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSjuUhv_2e5e7ne8YsCM8f7uzoSQlJ_IqU8LBedciyLPhQDl_YTcfWDbJXmQDUHiigH4m2U3ho4Fp9Z/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;amp;headers=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I ditched AT&amp;#x26;T for &lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile’s ONE Plus $80/month unlimited 4g data plan&lt;/strong&gt;, but there are other competitive options as well, namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://fi.google.com&quot;&gt;Google’s Project Fi&lt;/a&gt; (if you have or are willing to get a Google phone) and &lt;strong&gt;Sprint&lt;/strong&gt; (if you don’t mind 2g).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Fi has the best pricing, but I didn’t want to have to buy a Google phone. Sprint is cheaper than T-Mobile, but they don’t offer above 2g and I would’ve had to get a new phone because the Samsung Galaxy S6 I bought through AT&amp;#x26;T isn’t supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Provider&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Price ($/month)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Speed (Mbps)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ukrainian SIM card (Vodafone)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kiev (capital of Ukraine), Vodafone representatives literally sell SIM cards on the street, and using the SIM card is as simple as putting it in your phone - no configuration required. Given the dirty cheap price and the very fast speeds, getting a SIM card in Ukraine is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi Calling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi calling is often cheaper than regular calling. If your plan doesn’t have unlimited calling, see if Wi-Fi calling is any cheaper and use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Google Voice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Voice gives you free unlimited texting over WiFi, and Google Hangouts gives you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/rates?p=hangout&quot;&gt;cheap international WiFi calling ($0.01-$0.10).&lt;/a&gt; You just have to link your phone number or port it over with a $20 one-time fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Voice also allows you to forward your U.S. number to whatever mobile carrier you’re using, so that people can still reach you at your U.S. number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Alternatives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are some other even better plans out there that I’m not aware of. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firertc.com&quot;&gt;FireRTC&lt;/a&gt; claims to offer free calls to the U.S./Puerto Rico, Canada, and the UK. I wonder if there’s any catch. If you know of anything better that I missed, please let me know in the comments and I’ll update this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that traditional phone calling and texting is still even a thing given that the internet is free and more reliable (eg. Whatsapp, Telegram). If it weren’t for the fact that I’m only able to contact my bank for certain procedures via traditional phone and needing text confirmations for 2-factor authentication, I’d see no reason for phone/text service. Also as Americans we’re collectively getting ripped off by our telecom providers (eg. in France you can get unlimited everything for $20/month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to having unlimited data for the first time in my life though. I hear the speeds aren’t great, but we’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neofeudalism and the Parasite Economy (summarizing Michael Hudson)]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are two types of income: earned and unearned, aka economic rent.Economic Rent = Price — Instrinsic Cost ValueEconomic rent is the…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/neofeudalism-and-the-parasite-economy/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/neofeudalism-and-the-parasite-economy/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are two types of income: earned and unearned, aka economic rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Rent = Price — Instrinsic Cost Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic rent is the portion of earnings obtained not through one’s work, but via monopoly privilege (eg. land ownership).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two economies, the “real” economy and the rentier/parasite economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real economy consists of activity that actually contributes to society (eg. farming, manufacturing, healthcare)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parasite economy extracts wealth away from the real economy, adding unnecessary overhead to and shrinking the real economy. This is comprised of the FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate), monopolies, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are trending towards neufeudalism, where more and more of the disposable income in the real economy must be paid out to the parasite overclass to maintain the same standard of living. The is borne out through increasing cost of living and doing business. (The rising costs of land, education, healthcare etc. squeeze not only the 99%, but the businesses who must pay for their real estate, health insurance policies, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43% of income goes to mortgage debt service in America. 10–15% go to healthcare. Student loans are another 5–30%, then there’s automobile debt, 10–20% going to taxes, etc. This means that over 2/3 of one’s income is siphoned off to the parasite overlords. This shrinks the real economy, forcing it into greater austerity and debt while the rentier sector enjoys the gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80% of bank lending in the U.S. and Britain is mortgages. Debt, and specifically mortgage debt, is effectively the bank’s primary product. Since banks can effectively print money out of thin air, they’re only constrained by their ability to meet minimum reserve requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lending inflates asset prices, forcing people/businesses into more debt to obtain the same assets (eg. real estate, education), increasing bank profits but sucking money out of the real economy. As asset prices increase and interest payments accrue, debt grows exponentially, eventually outpacing the debtor’s ability to pay and leading to default/foreclosure and a market crash. At this point the creditors are bailed out while 10 million Americans lose their homes to creditors via foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do we kill the parasite?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop bailing out the creditors/rentiers/1% when the market crashes (ie. end trickle-down)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the recent 2008 financial recession, we bailed out the big banks and investors, or the 1%, rather than the 10 million Americans who lost their homes, 8 million Americans who lost their jobs, and 2.5 million businesses shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to end trickle-down economics. Instead of saving the failed fraudulent investments of the wealthy, we should save the people. Instead of trying to artificially prop up bad debts, write them down (debt jubilee). Instead of subsidizing banks via quantitative easing, spend that money on the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate artificial restrictions on housing supply that create housing shortages and inflate housing costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, 43% of income goes to mortgage debt service in America. This is money that could be directed towards the purchasing of goods/services or entrepreneurship in the real economy, but is instead siphoned off to the parasite overlords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflated cost of living also reduces a country’s competitiveness in the international market, moving industries and jobs overseas. The U.S. has seen a decimation in its manufacturing sector due in part to this, which it has been able to get by with in part due to the U.S. dollar being propped up due to it being the international reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ease zoning and eliminate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_%281978%29&quot;&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; and unnecessary regulations that restrict housing supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop taxing labor disproportionately more than capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax policy discussion often centers around income and sales tax — both labor taxes, while completely ignoring capital gains which is how wealthy people make most of their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1930 about 75% of state and local finances came from the property tax, and now it’s about 16%. Landlords are paying less of the tax burden while workers are paying more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax economic rent (unearned income)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned income should be the primary source of tax revenue because it doesn’t negatively distort markets. We should institute a land value tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put the power of money creation in public hands rather than private banks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, 97% of money is printed by private banks, not governments or the Federal Reserve. Private banks primarily use this power of money creation to speculate, drive up asset prices, and saddle everyone in as much debt as they can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason that money creation can’t be in the hands of the public with credit democratically allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to stand up for ourselves against our neofeudal parasite overlords. If labor doesn’t organize to end the pillaging and debt peonage of its people and the hemorrhaging of the real economy, then nobody else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Most of the mainideas here were borrowed from Michael Hudson’s work. This was my attempt to summarize his work, but I also added in some of my own thoughts as well so not everything here is associated with his name.

&lt;p&gt;Every time you roll the dice, you land on a piece of property owned by someone else, subsequently owing that property owner their share of “rent”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unless you were blessed with a nice inheritance or parents financially supporting you, you don’t have any money to give to the landlord because you started off with nothing. So in order to pay off your debt, you must figure out a way to obtain that money. This means working for someone else willing to pay you for your labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily a neighboring landlord is hiring for a property manager and takes a liking to you, so you get a job working for the other landlord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentially we have a game where the ownership/rentier class doesn’t have to do any work of their own, yet profits off the labor of the non-owners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-owner, the only way into the rentier class is to save enough money to buy out the properties (one may not be enough) of the owners. The feasibility of this is dependent on income relative to expenses (wages relative to rent) and property prices. Unfortunately wages are so low relative to property prices that only a relative minority are ever able to achieve this mobility into the rentier class within their lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more players enter the game (more people being born, immigration) but the supply of paid jobs don’t increase at a sufficient enough rate to accommodate the influx of demand for work (automation), the players’ bargaining power in the labor market reduces. This means reduced compensation, benefits, working conditions, and job security. A glut of aspiring workers relative to quality job openings means that families and random strangers have to start moving in together to afford the rent, and some even go homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this seem like a fair system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear as though the players starting off with nothing have too little power, while the incumbents — the rentier class who started off owning everything under your feet — have too much power. It seems unfair that one is forced to pay rent to some privileged person who doesn’t need to work, and the only way to get that money is to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we make the game more fair without eliminating property rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can give each player $200 every time they pass “Go”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this $200 come from? It can come from taxes on unearned income (eg. land value tax), negative externalities (Pigovian taxes), or perhaps even out of thin air from the bank (QE for the people, Modern Monetary Theory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This $200 is &lt;a href=&quot;/why-we-need-basic-income&quot;&gt;universal basic income.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why most jobs suck - Perception-based Management]]></title><description><![CDATA[When I first started working, I had this idealistic vision that I would be judged based on my results and my results alone.

In certain professions where one’s output can be easily quantified like sales and trading, this is indeed the case. But in most other professions where one’s contribution is not as easy to measure, one is valued based on an arcane combination of politics and lazy proxy metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came to the sobering realization that &lt;strong&gt;perception is valued more than anything else&lt;/strong&gt;. This perception is ultimately determined by one or two humans higher up in the corporate ladder - which in the case of technical roles in many cases don’t have the technical knowledge to actually know what you’re doing and evaluate your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your managers have the technical competency to evaluate your work, then work is more enjoyable because you know you will get credit where it’s due. You need to spend an extra day refactoring that code? Your boss understands. There is a sense of trust because there’s no black box here, you both know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your boss doesn’t have that technical competency is when things become less straightforward and perception starts playing a bigger role. And even when your boss is technically competent in what you’re doing, he is most likely answering to people who aren’t, and so he has to play the perception game with his bosses dragging you into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having to devote energy away from actual productive work and towards perception is what I would argue is the root of all that makes a job unpleasant.&lt;/strong&gt; I can deal with work that is drudgery if it’s meaningful, the burden is shared, and I get credit for it. But playing politics and sacrificing productivity to play up perception has always been my least favorite part of every job I’ve had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong a certain amount of perception grooming is unavoidable, but it’s been my experience that most companies go way too far to the point where it sacrifices productivity, increasing disillusionment and turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of lazy convenience-based management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong emphasis on being “available”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern corporate culture there is an overdone emphasis on being “available”, on being responsive to email or chat at the drop of a dime. In customer service and tech support type jobs this makes sense, in cognitively demanding jobs that often require deep focus like software engineering, this is absolutely ludicrous because constant interruptions are highly disruptive to this kind of deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport (computer science professor at Georgetown) has written an entire book on this called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X47ZVXM&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/06/08/jerry-seinfelds-closed-door/&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; he quotes Jerry Seinfeld:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me tell you why my tv series in the 90s was so good, besides just an inordinate amount of just pure good fortune. In most tv series, 50 percent of the time is spent working on the show, 50 percent of the time is spent dealing with personality, political, and hierarchical issues of making something. We spent 99 percent of our time writing. Me and Larry [David]. The two of us. The door was closed. It’s closed. Somebody calls. We’re not taking the call. We were gonna make this thing funny. That’s why the show was good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong emphasis on being present from 9am-5pm or in the office X hours/days. Hostility towards remote work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again unless this is a customer service or retail type job, this is just lazy perception-based management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How it feels to be back in the U.S. after 4 months in South America]]></title><description><![CDATA[I almost titled this “Back in America after 4 months in South America”, but after going to South America I’ve realized how arrogant it is to…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/back-in-the-us-after-4-months-in-south-america/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/back-in-the-us-after-4-months-in-south-america/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 12:00:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I almost titled this “Back in America after 4 months in South America”, but after going to South America I’ve realized how arrogant it is to refer to the U.S. as America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels weird to be back home and hear people speaking in English. I almost feel like a foreigner in my own home country. I like this feeling because everything I used to take for granted feels new, though I oddly miss hearing Spanish/Portuguese everywhere despite me not being fluent. The border control officer was actually very pleasant, which was a nice change of pace from the many rude ones I’ve dealt with in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are nice (at least in the moment):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to communicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared background with everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return policies. Stability. Knowing I can get anything done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to drink out of a water fountain / tap water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to flush toilet paper down the toilet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that stand out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are very diverse. There’s really no “average American” in terms of physical appearance. You’ve got white, black, Asian, Latin, indigenous, middle eastern, you name it. Despite white people being 60–80% of the U.S. population, it feels like they’re a minority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are noticeably fatter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The land is very sparsely developed. On the ride from the airport I mostly saw trees and undeveloped land with the occasional medium-sized building. In a city like Tokyo, Sao Paulo, or Bogota I’d be riding through a concrete jungle. Even in New York City, outside of Manhattan it’s not very dense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 1, the main highway nearby with chain restaurants and giant parking lots sprawled out is just as bland and uninspiring as ever. I don’t actually remember seeing anything resembling a Route 1 in South America. In South America and the rest of the world they like to give people the option of not being dependent on a car, so the chain stores would be more within walking distance of each other and consolidated inside malls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one benefit to sprawl is that you get more room and more quiet. I’m always impressed returning to my family’s house especially since it’s always a little nicer every time I come back due to renovations. It’s spacious and the only ambience I hear is the faint sound of birds chirping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did just find out that my parents got rid of the spare cars, so now there are only 2 family cars that my parents both use to commute to work. So now I’ll be carless except at nights and on weekends. Without a car here I can’t really go anywhere. Public transit doesn’t really exist — the nearest subway station is a 1 hour 20 minute walk away, or a 35 minute bus ride. I’ll basically be dependent on Uber (10 years ago before Uber I would’ve just been screwed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, staying here at my parents’ house has become less appealing than it already was, which may not be a bad thing if it gets me more motivated to work my way out. And now that I can’t drive to Chipotle maybe I’ll finally learn how to cook…&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I Left NYC]]></title><description><![CDATA[When I first interned in NYC my junior summer I fell in love with the city and vowed to move there after college.After graduation I went…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-i-left-nyc/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-i-left-nyc/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I first interned in NYC my junior summer I fell in love with the city and vowed to move there after college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation I went straight to NYC and loved it. There was nowhere else I wanted to be. I loved the energy of the city, the ability to go anywhere by foot/bike/subway (a rarity in America despite being common in the rest of the world), the cosmopolitan nature of it, and feeling like I’m at the center of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I was short of inspiration, a quick walk through West Village or Midtown would do the trick - admiring the beautiful brownstones amidst the elegant tree-lined streets and cobblestone roads, probably housing celebrities - or peering up in awe at the enormous glass skyscrapers dominating the skyline, resided by what must be the most successful businessmen and brilliant minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something incredibly motivating being here, amidst the most successful and driven people in the world, and it made me want to be something. In NYC, the world was my oyster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 3 years, and I was tired of it all. My apartment was crap and the rent was too high. The subway was a dump and getting worse every year (“we are delayed because of train traffic ahead”). Winter was cold, dark, and miserable. My job was lame, and so was everybody else’s. Rather than being a hub for the most creative and talented people, I felt like I was in a white collar frat house, except without the crazy parties or sense of community. Walking the streets, all I saw were tourists, zombie-eyed corporate shmucks shuffling to and from their corporate cages like zoo animals in a rat race, and homeless mentally unstable people shouting homophobic slurs directed at nobody in particular. The glass luxury towers no longer inspired me, they pissed me off - why can’t we build affordable modest housing instead of every new building catering to Russian oligarchs and Chinese Communist Party officials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to be dissatisfied, it’s another to no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel. After 5 years of watching rents and housing prices rise without any increase in housing quality, the subway getting increasingly delayed and unreliable, streets getting increasingly congested (look at Herald Square), and gentrification commodifying what were once culturally rich neighborhoods into white collar frat houses (see Williamsburg), ear-piercing police sirens every 5 minutes instead of every 10 minutes, I didn’t see a future for me in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYC is a playground for the rich, a rat race for everyone else. New Yorkers are so caught up in the facade of being some high culture mecca and innovation capital that they haven’t realized that the spirit is already dead, gentrified beyond recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s unfair of me to so harshly bash NYC. Maybe I was in the wrong job and didn’t take the effort to join and/or create my ideal community. Maybe I just wanted to try something new for a change instead of spending my entire 20s in one city. I did have wanderlust after all, always wanting to live abroad. Manhattan is geographically very small, and there’s only so many times you can walk the same streets without getting tired of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYC definitely has a “work really long hours at your meaningless corporate job that you pretend like you’re super passionate about and would debate remaining in if you won the lottery” culture that I don’t identify with. Kind of like the TV show “Silion Valley” - cut the crap, you’re not changing the world. The exorbitant livings costs make most people completely financially dependent on their jobs, meaning their employers have them by the balls (as George Carlin would say). Hence the longer hours, decreased workplace flexibility and opportunity to work remotely, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Fix NYC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to just be an unconstructive hater, so I’ll offer some suggestions to improve NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one problem is cost of living, and quality of living. It’s not news that most people pay exhorbitant prices to live in tiny shoeboxes in squalor. Yet rather than build more modest housing, the only new buildings that get built are luxury apartments catering to billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build more modest affordable housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put down your neoliberal propaganda books for a second, admit that the market is failing, and start looking for real solutions, which may involve the government getting its hands dirty. Giving tax breaks in exchange for making luxury developers allocate a portion of their luxury units to poor people (to which there is an enormous waiting list for) is not even cracking a dent in the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems is that there are regulations on minimum apartment size that prevent the development of very small apartments. This is ridiculous and needs to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostels are banned in NYC. This also needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoning could also be loosensed, especially in the not-so-dense outer boroughs. Japan has a great zoning model that allows a greater deal of flexibility than the American model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fix the subway, expand access, and improve interborough transportation (double-benefit of increasing affordable housing)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major failure is the subway, which has been getting noticeably worse every single year (verified by the MTA’s very own statistics, which by design understate the problem). I didn’t last a month in Astoria because catching the subway to work was such an enormous hassle. Similar situation for anyone relying on the L train. Time to fix and modernize the subway system (props to The New York Times for calling the MTA out on their incompetency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the subway has the double-benefit of easing the affordable housing crisis by expanding housing access to farther geographic areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subway access is fairly good within Manhattan, but is absolute garbage outside of it. Traveling to and from Queens and Brooklyn for example is a nightmare, and generally requires going into Manhattan. This makes it inconvenient to have offices outside of Manhattan. If interborough transportation were improved, then we could see more development in the less dense boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens instead of trying to squeeze more density out of a Manhattan already at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fix the constant ear-piercing police and fire truck sirens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hearing is probably worse due to this. This is ridiculous, and not something that other equally dense cities have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have zero confidence that NYC will take serious steps to solve these issues, and this is why NYC will continue to lag behind other cities in terms of modernization, innovation, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico City Impressions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mexico City was the first stop on my world tour, and these are my impressions after 1 week.I’ll be completely honest - I originally had no…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/mexico-city/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/mexico-city/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mexico City was the first stop on my world tour, and these are my impressions after 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be completely honest - I originally had no interest in going to Mexico City, and only went because the flight was so cheap ($117 one-way from Baltimore), it was on my way to South America, and it was recommended to me by some friends. I was told by many people that the city was extremely dangerous and that I should probably avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m so glad I went, and now want to see the rest of Mexico (Yucatan, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guadalajara, etc). I had no idea that Mexico was so rich in culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I never felt unsafe in Mexico City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people told me that Mexico City is very dangerous, that you can’t wander around without knowing where you’re going, that if you venture one street off the main path you’ll be in danger. This is completely false. I never felt unsafe in Mexico City, even walking around alone past midnight. As long as you don’t venture into bad areas (I hear they’re in the north?) and are street smart, you’ll be fine (more on safety below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that stood out to me about Mexico City is all the street hawkers/vendors, and this seems to be a common thing in most of central and South America. On my Uber ride from the airport to the hostel there were people at traffic intersections selling food and beverages to vehicles (something I’ve never seen in the U.S.) and offering to wash windows. On the streets and in the subway you’ve got people selling everything, and tons of shoe shiners. There are massive street markets that sell everything, and street food everywhere selling tacos and other things. Out of all the places I’ve been to so far, Mexico City has the most street food I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon first seeing this, the first thought that sprang to my mind was - capitalism, where if you don’t have any money, then you must convince somebody to buy something they don’t need. But I came to really appreciate and respect the street hustlers and the entrepreneurial nature of it all, preferring to purchase through them than through stores. You can buy pretty much everything you need off the street for a fraction of the price that you’d be paying in a store, and your money goes directly to the people rather than to the handful of wealthy business owners and landlords (I’m not going to pretend I know the intricacies of it, this is just what I like to believe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My funniest memory of Mexico City was sitting on a subway train when a lady comes in to sell markers for 5 pesos. She makes her pitch, explaining how great the markers are and how much of a good value they are. I’m laughing to myself thinking that this is absurd - why the hell would anybody on this subway train want to buy a marker right now? There’s no way she’s making any sales here. Then to my complete shock somebody pulls out some cash and buys some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My absolute favorite thing about Mexico City is the street food. 95% of what I ate in Mexico City was street tacos. They’re delicious and dirt cheap, we’re talking 2-3 generous sized tacos for $1. The only problem was that I ate way too damn much because everytime I’d pass by a taco stand I’d think “ah, what the hell, it’s just $1.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s interesting about the food vendors is that most people eat “to stay”, even when there’s no seating. If you eat “to stay”, then they give you a plate wrapped in plastic that you then return to them when you’re finished. In NYC, when you’re getting fast food alone the default epectation is that you’re getting it “to go” (never made sense to me unless I’m planning to eat in the park or something).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned how cheap the street food is, but everything is cheaper. Riding the subway is 5 pesos ($0.27). I’m pretty sure I saw shoes on sale for $12. Only thing that won’t be cheaper is brand name stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mexican People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican people are very laid-back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some American circles there’s this absurd stereotypes of Mexicans being lazy. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Mexicans work the most hours out of every country in the world (according to OECD). Given all the street hawkers/vendors out there who’s livelihoods depend on their sales, I’d wager that the average Mexican is actually more entrepreneurial than the average American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salsa dancing is pretty popular here. I saw the occasional salsa dancing on the street, which was really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women are more traditional than in the US. Many are Christian. In terms of physical appearance, most seem to be a mixture with indigenous roots, though there’s a decent amount of diversity. Obesity is fairly prevalent, probably on par with the U.S. Many Mexicans told me that the most beautiful Mexican women are on the coast in cities like Guadalajara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is a bit chillier than you’d expect because of its high elevation (2,250m). In January I generally found myself wearing a jacket at night, and sometimes during the day as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is rich in history, being the oldest capital city in the Americas, built in 1325 by the Aztecs upon them seeing the prophetic Eagle with a snake on its beak perched on a cactus (on the Mexican flag), later being a Spanish colony, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is huge - bigger than NYC both by population and geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is walkable with what seems to be just the right amount of density. Lots of nice parks, beautiful statues, nice historic architecture, etc. The La Roma and Condesa neighborhoods (upscale neighborhoods) are really nice, with lots of trees lining the roads (this simple thing makes a huge difference in a city, that’s why the West Village and Upper East Side in NYC are so nice). They’ve got a bike share system as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the public art in the city. There’s a cool Salvador Dali park, and lots of beautiful graffiti and statues. The art is often very surreal, which I love.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re into museums, Mexico City has amongst the most museums in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pleasant thing I noticed was that I never hear any police sirens, and this seems to be the case in every other Latin American city I’ve visited so far. In NYC, the constant ear-piercing sirens was one of the things I hated the most about the city. Good to know that there are cities with comparable density without this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main negatives to me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can’t drink the tap water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Quality isn’t great. Smog. My sense of smell isn’t that sensitive so it didn’t really bother me, but I could see it bothering those with a sensitive sense of smell, and I wonder what the long term impacts are (I was only there 1 week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of public trash cans. It’s surprisingly difficult to find a public trash can. Often I’d buy street tacos to go, and end up holding the tray for a ridiculously long time due to inability to find a trash can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic (though honestly, it seems that traffic in every major city in 2018 is horrible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go ahead and mention safety only because in the grand scheme of things, Mexico City is not going to be safe as an Asian city. I personally didn’t have any problems, even walking around alone past midnight, but I have heard some stories - usually in the more sketchy lesser known areas. One of the guys at my hostel was in one of those areas and watched a thief snatch the earrings off a lady in front of him and run off. Honestly though, I think that as long as you’re street smart, the odds of anything happening is very small. Take Ubers instead of taxis, don’t put your phone/wallet in your back pocket, put your bag in front of you when on a crowded subway, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only negative experience I had was when buying a bus ticket to Teotihuacan (the pyramids). I paid the 104 pesos with a 200 peso bill, and received 20 pesos ($1.08) less in change than I was owed. I gave the change back to her, and she gave me the correct change without even apologizing. Could’ve been an innocent mistake, but given her body language and such I think it was deliberate. Other than this though, people were very nice and didn’t rip me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There doesn’t seem to be any more homeless people than you see in American cities like NYC. If anything it seems like there are less homeless people. The difference is that the homeless people tend to be women (in America it seems to be the reverse), and they often have babies and/or little children - something you rarely see in the homeless in the US. Sometimes the kids are playing instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think Mexico City is a great city with a rich history and culture. The street food is abundant, delicious, and cheap. The stigma of Mexico City being very dangerous is completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the digital nomad, it’d make a great base due to how cheap everything is. Just be aware that most Mexicans speak very little to no English (seems to be the case in most of Latin America).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullet-point summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not dangerous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street hawkers/vendors everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing street tacos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice parks and public art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of history and museums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good level of walkability and density (compared to US)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how cheap the flights are from the U.S. (my one-way ticket from Baltimore was only $117), I really think that every American should check out this city even if just for a 3 day weekend, especially in the wake of all this baseless racist vitriol leveled against Mexicans by our idiot president - calling them rapists and criminals - and fanatically obsessed with building a stupid wall that won’t accomplish anything. Most Mexicans are peaceful hardworking people, and I’m fairly sure most Mexicans don’t want to move to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at DF Suites Hostel. I really enjoyed my stay there, mainly due to the people. It seemed like 90% of the guests there were solo travelers (at most hostels that number feels more like 33%), and thus it was very easy to meet people. I think this is because Mexico City is not very touristy, and thus the people that go there are more likely to be solo travelers. The breakfast in the mornings is pretty good, and the terraces are nice. Group trip to Lubra Libre wrestling on Wednesdays and Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest downside is that the internet is very unreliable from the rooms (it’s fine in the common areas). The location is downtown and walking distance to a lot of the historical sights, but it’s fairly dead at night and not in the most “hip” location. Next time I’ll probably stay in the more upscale La Roma or Condesa neighborhoods where the nightlife is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starbucks has free WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get WiFi at the airports and in parks if you enter your email (there’s a button on the right of the sign-on screen that reveals a box to enter your email), but it only lasts 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can buy 1L bottled watter for 8 pesos at the grocery markets that the locals go to.&lt;/li&gt;

I know this is going to sound super cheesy, but I’m not going to sacrifice realness to try to look “cool”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the day exploring the city, and the evening hanging out with people from all over the world, talking about everything from travels to politics and crypto. I’ve heard all kinds of stories about adventures in countries all over the world, from people way more interesting than me who’ve traveled everywhere. Most people are traveling alone, but we all share this common bond of loving to adventure and explore foreign cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still blown away at how interesting and well-traveled everyone is. People here have traveled the world and have all kinds of stories to tell. I’m like a suburban child among peers of the “world’s most interesting man” from the Dox Equis commercial. I honestly feel kind of inadequate, not only when it comes to travel stories, but culture, international politics, history, etc. I’ll nod and absorb the knowledge, but often have very little to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest eye-opener to me has been how interesting everybody is. Even in NYC, most of the people I interacted with were fairly boring. Work boring office job, sleep, work, sleep, repeat. It’s so prevalent and ingrained in our culture that I almost felt guilty for having wanderlust and wanting to try new things and see new places. Because that makes me an uncommitted engineer/employee, not “mature enough”, not fit for the “adult” world. Plus you’ve got six figures of student loan debt with ~7% interest, how can you even consider extensive traveling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my very first job I’ve always had the desire to travel extensively (something I couldn’t do prior to my first job because I didn’t have any money). My dream from the very beginning was to get a remote job. For each of my 3 years in the workforce, I vowed to ask/tell my employer that I’d be working remotely this summer, and move to Barcelona. Each summer it never happened. At first I was too afraid because I figured they wouldn’t allow it, but the last summer I legitimately had convinced myself that I probably wouldn’t be happier abroad anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See not only was I forgoing my own happiness, but I was becoming one of those boring people I had tried so hard to avoid becoming. By the time I left my job, I had almost completely lost my desire to travel, thinking that it was probably overrated anyways and might make me less productive. Had it not been for the fact that I was so &lt;a href=&quot;/why-i-left-nyc&quot;&gt;fed up with NYC&lt;/a&gt; and its high cost of living, I might not even have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so glad I left. My eyes have been opened. I met a guy from Whales who quit his job 3 times to travel, traveling for a year, and then returning back to the same employer each time (he was worried that they wouldn’t let him back this time). I met a woman who quit her job in NYC to travel, and ended up spending 2 years traveling the world and living in Australia. I met a guy from Chicago who had quit his last job to travel for a year, and now at the end of an epic 3 week trip to South America was planning to quit his job back home to travel. I met a chemist from England who had quit his job multiple times to travel, and had spent the last 6 months living in New Zealand and was on his way to trek through South America and hike through Patagonia. I partied with a Swiss software engineer who was on a 2 month vacation traveling through Latin America (yes, his company was letting him take a 2 month paid vacation) and a 25 year old who owns 15 vape shops in London and now travels the world (he recently bought a Bentley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hostel, these are your average peers. In an average office, your average peers are often boring, basic, and unambitious (note: obviously this is a generalization and doesn’t apply to every company).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate offices. Maybe it’s just American culture, but I hate how politically correct it is. I hate how you have to pretend like you love your job, that there’s nothing else you’d rather be doing, and that there’s nowhere else you’d rather be. Not all jobs are like that, but most are (especially software engineering jobs in NYC). It’s the one thing I missed the most about school, the freedom to speak your mind and be whoever you want, to question things, to criticize your bosses. Ultimately none of this has any effect on your grades (at least in the hard sciences). In an (American) company, your boss can literally fire you for anything, even if it has nothing to do with your performance. Most American workers live precarious lives on the brink, one arbitrary firing away from insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the light, and there’s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why we need a Basic Income]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed” -William Gibson“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-we-need-basic-income/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/why-we-need-basic-income/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed” -William Gibson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.” -Jeff Hammerbacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the implementation of a universal basic income (UBI) is the single most important policy decision that needs to be made right now. It’s the one issue I’ve been obsessed with over the last couple years, and here’s why it’s so important:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot;
          &gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody in a wealthy first-world country should have to starve or go homeless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superior to our welfare system.&lt;/strong&gt; Eliminates &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap&quot;&gt;welfare trap problem&lt;/a&gt;, ensures that everyone is covered, guts bloated bureaucracy, removes (humiliating) means-testing, more efficient allocation of resources due to free market approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_of_bargaining_power&quot;&gt;asymmetric bargaining power&lt;/a&gt; between employers and employees&lt;/strong&gt; by eliminating employees’ financial dependence on their employers, &lt;strong&gt;giving workers true autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; and ending the exploitative relationship of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery&quot;&gt;wage slavery&lt;/a&gt;. No more need for inefficient bandaid patches like minimum wage and various labor laws that attempt to tackle the symptoms without addressing the root cause. Employees can now walk away at any time (without disqualifying themselves from unemployment insurance), meaning they can finally bargain for better conditions and reduced hours. Less interview dynamic of interviewee trying desperately to prove himself to smug interviewer. Unemployment rate would tank. Threat of starvation/homelessness should not be the backbone of our labor market, and this Feudalistic master/slave, indentured servant, father/son type dynamic between employers and employees needs to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote entrepreneurship and greater risk-taking.&lt;/strong&gt; Now anyone can be an entrepreneur without needing to either (1) have a lot of money, or (2) convince rich people to give you money. The safety net of the UBI means greater risk-taking, and more innovation. UBI (and welfare in general) is to citizens as bankruptcy law is to limited liability companies. You shouldn’t need a trust fund or an inheritance to safely start a business or pursue an unorthodox career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More work for the greater good.&lt;/strong&gt; We have a bullshit jobs phenomenon and most of our brightest graduates are brain drained into finance and consulting, yet most of these same people would rather be working on more meaningful problems. Giving workers autonomy would mean more MIT grads pursuing cancer research than algorithmic trading at hedge funds, computer science grads creating innovative open source software instead of proprietary software, political science grads working to fix and modernize our political system, volunteering, education, etc. &lt;strong&gt;We could all be tenured professors.&lt;/strong&gt; When the threat of starvation and homelessness is removed, we can start focusing less on money and more on the greater good and investing for the long-term (eg. more efficient batteries, renewable energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More political representation of the non-wealthy.&lt;/strong&gt; The interests of the non-wealthy masses are underrepresented because they don’t have the time or mental capacity (working 40+ hours/week drains most of it) to dedicate towards political activism. UBI would allow more people to focus on fixing and upgrading our broken political system, arguably the biggest obstacle to our progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make people happier.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a crisis going on right now in our society in that far too many people are working jobs they don’t enjoy, yet are unable to walk away due to financial dependence and a culture that shames “job-hoppers”. Pundits put an extraordinary amount of emphasis on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdiculous.blogspot.com/2016/05/david-rothkopf-gdp-doesnt-measure.html&quot;&gt;faulty metrics like GDP&lt;/a&gt; while totally ignoring happiness, but if we’re not working towards happiness then what are we working for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevents society from collapsing due to technological automation.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU&quot;&gt;Technology is automating away human labor&lt;/a&gt;, creating mass shortages of (quality) jobs. Without a UBI or an alternative solution, we’ll see mass unemployment/underemployment and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotes technological automation.&lt;/strong&gt; Our fear of eliminating jobs is actually holding back technological advancement. We should be encouraging automation rather than fearing it, and UBI allows us to do that in good conscious because job elimination would no longer mean starvation/homelessness. Furthermore, the resulting increase in the cost of labor for less enjoyable lines of work (due to the normalizing of the negotiation imbalance between employers and employees) would increase the ROI of automation, further incentivizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this one simple policy change would have massive societal repercussions, causing a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a UBI, our labor force is a perpetual arms race of increasing competition for a scarcer set of jobs, meaning increased concentration of power among the 1%. With a UBI, technological advancement becomes something to be celebrated rather than feared — self-driving cars means 3.5 million people are now free to spend more time with their kids and work on whatever they want, rather than starve or go homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBI means workers would have the freedom to work on whatever they want rather than what the people with money dictate. Work would no longer necessitate monetary profits, meaning that more work would be done for the greater good of humanity, and we could start eliminating bullshit jobs and parasitic rent-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d see a cultural and intellectual renaissance greater than anything we’ve ever seen before in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most importantly, we’d all finally have freedom over our time — our most valuable (non-renewable) resource — and be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In future articles, I’ll go more in depth and respond to common counterarguments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most people I know have never heard of “liquid democracy”, so I made this video introducing the concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.” -Employee fired by Google over non-politically-correct memo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo&quot;&gt;Google recently fired an employee&lt;/a&gt; over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586-Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.html#document/p6&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; he posted criticizing the company’s diversity policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic that a company that apparently cares enough about diversity to have a “Vice President for Diversity” fired an employee for presenting an opposing viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some takeaways from this whole fiasco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/E6cxRYgqfHY&quot;&gt;Diversity has absolutely nothing to do with diversity of thought.&lt;/a&gt; Diversity is only concerned with normalizing racial/gender composition to reflect the overall population in settings where men, whites, and Asians are overrepresented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain topics, especially anything involving diversity and gender issues, are not allowed to be questioned or debated. Having a contrarian view on these topics is offensive, makes you a sexist/racist, and is grounds for social ostracization and getting fired from your job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The media will turn anything it can into a scandal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of those politically correct assertions that take on almost religious-like qualities in the sense that the mere questioning of them is blasphemy and will get you socially lambasted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no biological differences between men and women that may influence their predisposition towards certain kinds of work (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/14/summers-comments-on-women-and-science/&quot;&gt;Larry Summers is apparently sexist for even suggesting the possibility&lt;/a&gt;). Any statement that perpetuates female stereotypes is sexist, even an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/12/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-ignites-social-media-firestorm/&quot;&gt;innocuous joke&lt;/a&gt; (or even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/&quot;&gt;misconstrued joke in someone else’s private conversation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sexist to suggest that men tend to be better than women at certain things, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7.com/4377601/&quot;&gt;it’s not sexist when you reverse the genders&lt;/a&gt; (note that this directly contradicts the previous bullet point). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/&quot;&gt;Women are underpaid compared to men for the same work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men, especially white men, are always more privileged and do not face discrimination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrimination against men, whites, and Asians is justified if its done to promote underrepresented minorities (affirmative action)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rape is about power and has nothing to do with sex &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/105393-prostitution-decriminalized-rhode-islands-experiment&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostitution is sexist against women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalizing prostitution increases human trafficking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/105393-prostitution-decriminalized-rhode-islands-experiment&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a female accuses a man of rape, the man is guilty until proven innocent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress_Performance_%28Carry_That_Weight%29&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/magazine/the-lessons-of-stanfords-sex-assault-case-reversal.html&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?id=4300383&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men’s rights activists are sexist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism is the best economic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputing any of these gender-related views is offensive, and it’s your responsibility that I’m offended and emotionally uncomfortable over being presented an alternative viewpoint. I must be coddled from opposing viewpoints, such as via trigger warnings and safe spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the double standard here. It’s only considered sexist or racist when it makes underrepresented minorities look bad, and depending on the context. For example: saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476221&quot;&gt;women are more empathetic than men&lt;/a&gt; generally isn’t considered sexist, but it becomes sexist when it’s used to suggest that it may have something to do with why women are less likely to pursue computer programming as a profession. Women being underrepresented in tech is an urgent national problem caused only by discrimination, but men being underrepresented in psychology, education, and nursing isn’t a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political Correctness: Anti-intellectual dogmatism and hostility against select non-mainstream viewpoints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC culture can also be leveraged to one’s advantage outside of the topics at hand. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/285-17/mayor-de-blasio-signs-bill-prohibiting-all-nyc-employers-inquiring-salary-history-job#/0&quot;&gt;NYC recently passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting employers from inquiring about salary history of job applicants. The bill benefits all job applicants unanimously and has nothing to do with gender/race (just like raising the minimum wage is not an “African American” bill), yet the heading in their own press release reads “City takes major step toward achieving pay equity for women and people of color”, leading one to wonder if the same bill would have been passed had it not been framed in terms of the “gender gap”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC culture suppresses non-PC viewpoints via ad hominem attacks such as via name-calling (eg. sexist, racist), which is intellectually hostile, juvenile, and anti-diversity (similar to the Church in the old days shaming and executing scientists for having viewpoints that didn’t align with the church’s agenda). The viewpoint not aligning with one’s agenda does not excuse this behavior. The claim that intellectual censoring is justified because certain people are too sensitive to handle the opposing viewpoint and thus must be coddled is also nonsensical, especially considering that the reverse is almost always permissible (the double standard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role of the Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American public needs to realize that the media is facilitating these “scandals”, perpetuating this culture of political correctness and knee-jerk public lynching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media, which profits almost exclusively off ad revenue from views, is incentivized to turn anything it can into a scandal because it translates to more attention and money (employing tactics such as “clickbait” and sensationalism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first article to reveal this memo was written by Gizmodo and titled: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320&quot;&gt;“Exclusive: Here’s The Full 10-Page Anti-Diversity Screed Circulating Internally at Google”&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/the-most-common-error-in-coverage-of-the-google-memo/536181/?single_page=true&quot;&gt;similar damning headlines were used in numerous other mainstream media outlets.&lt;/a&gt; CNN’s snapchat coverage on the story was titled “Sexist Manifesto Puts Google in Hot Seat”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody who actually read the memo will see that it is not “anti-diversity” or “sexist”. The memo literally opens with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don’t endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can’t have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the media’s overarching influence over public perception, their reporting becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating scandals out of thin air and skewing public perception to serve their interests (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morriscreative.com/wp2011/assets/2012/06/info.jpg&quot;&gt;6 corporations own 90% of the media&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a hostile culture of dogmatism and anti-intellectualism (ie. political correctness)&lt;/strong&gt; around certain topics, and it’s disgraceful. &lt;strong&gt;Constructive criticism and contrarian arguments should be encouraged rather than silenced, critiqued on the merit of their arguments rather than being the brunt of personal attacks accusing the author of sexism/racism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media also needs to be held accountable for perpetuating this anti-intellectual PC culture via their clickbait headlines and disingenuous sensationalism. This applies not only to the media, but also online communities such as Reddit where the default subreddits blatantly censor dissenting viewpoints and promote echo-chamber hivemind mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot begin to come to a solution without first identifying the problem. &lt;strong&gt;Political correctness is a problem&lt;/strong&gt;, and needs to be treated as such. The gross perversion of political correctness is a huge reason why Donald Trump, perhaps the least politically correct U.S. presidential candidate in history, won the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard of some college campuses where they don’t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative, or they don’t want to read a book if it had language that is offensive to African Americans or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I’ve got to tell you, I don’t agree with that either — that you when you become students at colleges, you have to be coddled and protected from different points of view. Anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with them, but you shouldn’t silence them by saying you can’t come because I’m too sensitive to hear what you have to say.” -Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthyism is still alive, it’s just taken a different form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Education System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Day after day we are cornered into an unrelenting competition that smothers and suffocates us…We couldn’t even spare 30 minutes for our troubled classmates because of all our homework.” -Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Student Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite boasting some of the world’s highest test scores and the world’s highest high school graduation rate (97%), student happiness is ranked among the worst in the world, suicide rates the highest, and students undergo conditions not unlike that of a prison labor camp &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/world/asia/23southkorea.html&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-children-idUSKBN0IO0OA20141104&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/KOR?lg=en&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school begins at 7:30am and ends at 10pm (yes, the school cafeterias actually serve dinner), after which students go home and typically study for another 2–3 more hours before falling asleep around 2–3am. They sleep for 4 hours, and wake up to repeat the cycle for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gym class is twice per week, but the students are so sleep deprived that the time is often used to nap, or for the most dedicated — to cram in more studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to prepare for the college entrance exam, the outcome of which largely dictates the rest of your life due to society’s extraordinary academic elitism. Getting into a top university all comes down to the score you get on that exam, as well as selecting the optimum combination of schools to apply to (you’re not allowed to submit your score to more than 3 schools). You also need to select a major for your college application, after which it’s practically impossible to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not unlike the rest of the world, elite colleges are disproportionally represented by children of the wealthy — almost to a comical extent — for the obvious reasons that their parents are able to invest more in their education to game the system. The stereotypical student at Seoul National University grew up in Gangnam (highest real estate prices in the country), spent some years living abroad (English test scores are critical for getting accepted to good schools and good companies), went to expensive private schools, and have rich parents who are doctors, lawyers, or something of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cutthroat Job Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this &lt;strong&gt;ultra-competitive education system stems from the ultra-competitive job market&lt;/strong&gt;, and it really can’t be overstated how competitive it is for young people to find decent work in Korea these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s standard for students to take 1–2 years off before graduating to prepare for the rigorous and demanding job application process because companies prefer to hire students who haven’t yet graduated. They prepare for the TOEIC English exam (scores expire after 2 years) and company-specific entrance exams that the big conglomerates require their applicants to undergo and offer only twice per year (though Samsung ended theirs this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name brand is incredibly important, so if you don’t graduate from a top university, you’re basically screwed. Only a select minority will make it into the big conglomerates after undergoing their rigorous and lengthy interviews and company-specific entrance exams. Those unable to land jobs at these prized companies have to compete for work at smaller companies offering half the salary ($24k/yr), and relegate themselves to careers of mediocrity due to the lack of prestige in their company’s brand names in a name-brand obsessed society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of the desperation of those without the prestige of a brand name university: last year’s entrance exam for the position of a lowly public servant — possibly the only job in the country where one’s candidacy is based solely on a test score — received 200,000 applicants for 3,846 openings, a 1.9% acceptance rate. All that for a job stamping documents for $1,400/month. (And the exam is offered only once per year) &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/jQyJv-Pk0hc&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work culture is absolutely brutal and militant-like in its hierarchical authoritarian structure. Nobody is allowed to leave before their boss, so &lt;strong&gt;everybody stays at the office until 8–11pm everyday&lt;/strong&gt;. Unconditional obedience to your boss is expected, and any sort of questioning of their opinions is asking for a pink slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Institutionalized Nepotism and Plutocracy&lt;/h3&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korean resumes require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo, blatantly used to discriminate against ugly people, people with dark skin, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age, height, and weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marital status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents’ names, ages, occupations, and whether or not you live with them. Same for siblings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyesight and illnesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://terms.naver.com/imageDetail.nhn?docId=2356797&amp;#x26;imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdbscthumb.phinf.naver.net%2F3703_000_1%2F20141209162528557_UIYBOCMB3.jpg%2Fba17_12260_i1.jpg%3Ftype%3Dm4500_4500_fst%26wm%3DN&amp;#x26;categoryId=51373&amp;#x26;mode=simple%7C&amp;#x26;query=&amp;#x26;authorId=&amp;#x26;authorId=&quot;&gt;Some companies even ask how much money you have in your bank account.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to fathom as an outsider in a Western culture, but a job applicants’ parents’ occupations actually matter a great deal. The more prestigious their work, the higher your odds of getting that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korean companies don’t even pretend to not discriminate in favor of physically attractive people. That’s why Korea boasts the highest plastic surgery rates in the world. It’s typical of job interviews to start off with “icebreakers” like “so do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big corporations expect you to have studied abroad in countries like the U.S. and Canada, something only possible for those who’s parents can afford it. Companies value the international exposure and the English skills (despite the fact that employees rarely use English), particularly because public schools fail to teach proper English speaking skills. English is taught more like a math or science to game the exams, which don’t test speaking ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, name brand is paramount. Despite the resume asking for names of previous employers and job titles, there’s actually no section for describing what you actually did at your jobs because it’s not important enough for the resume. No matter how experienced and removed from school you are, education is always listed at the top because your alma matter is of upmost importance. Working at less prestigious companies confines you to a career working at less prestigious companies, which unlike the U.S. means accepting drastically lower compensation and longer (unpaid) hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent survey, 78.6% of adults said they would emigrate if they could, and 47.9% of those people said they were already preparing to leave. The most common reasons cited were lack of work life balance, poor working conditions, severe income inequality, anxiety about jobs and life after retirement, and the competitive environment. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/01/116_195720.html&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, you have an extraordinarily competitive education system that pits high school students against each other in school for 14 hours/day in preparation for a college entrance exam, after which upon graduating they’ll compete against each other for a limited set of jobs at employers that demand 14 hour workdays ruled by strict, authoritarian regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None of this is specific only to Korea, Korea just takes it all to its logical extreme and doesn’t even pretend like it’s not doing these things.&lt;/strong&gt; American employers also discriminate against older married women on the verge of pregnancy (and always will as long as it’s advantageous for them to do so), they just lack the boldness to explicitly demand that information on their applicants’ resumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, all of these problems&lt;/strong&gt; — from the inhumane education system to the brutal wage slave working conditions to the blatant discrimination on everything from physical appearance to your parents’ ages and job titles — &lt;strong&gt;stem from the ultra-competitive labor market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government can enact laws all they want such as &lt;strong&gt;mandatory curfews for cram schools&lt;/strong&gt;, anti-discrimination laws, and regulation promoting better work-life balance, but those can only haphazardly address the symptoms without addressing the underling root cause (like trying to lower the suicide rate by mandating more nets on tall buildings). When there are too many people fighting for too few slots, no curfew law is going to have the desired impact. There will always be people willing to work longer hours when the alternative is starvation and social estrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does a country fix an ultra-competitive labor market?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to frame the problem correctly. The problem is not that there are too many people chasing too few jobs (this is the state of every single first world country), &lt;strong&gt;the problem is that people need jobs in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income&quot;&gt;Universal Basic Income (UBI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is one policy proposal that would eliminate the dependence of people on jobs, which in Korea’s case would have enormous reverberating implications throughout not only their job market and work culture but also their education system. Being in school for 14 hours/day would suddenly become an option rather than a necessity required in order to escape a humiliating life of poverty, unrespected work, parental dependence, and limited dating options. Rather than an outdated industrial-education complex that breeds overly passive and obedient workers, true individuality would finally be made possible. All the time wasted showing facetime for one’s boss, often within commoditized companies endlessly competing against each other in zero-sum games for profit, could become a thing of the past. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@wageslave/end-wage-slavery-af14287f4737&quot;&gt;The wage slaves would be freed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Jae-myung (described to me as a combination of Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama), the mayor of a prominent city next to Seoul who finished 3rd in the Democratic primary in the recent presidential election, is a huge advocate for a basic income funded by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax&quot;&gt;land value tax.&lt;/a&gt; He’s already implemented a basic income for 19–24 year olds in his city and is striving to get it implemented at the national level. &lt;a href=&quot;http://basicincome.org/news/2017/02/korea-new-presidential-candidate-lee-jae-myung-promises-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all stuck in endless competition against each other, but for what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we’re competing on, we lose sight of anything that’s important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world.” -Peter Thiel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if one can’t swallow the idea of a first world country with an unconditional safety net, there’s always the possibility of the government creating jobs for its citizens in order to employ those left out by the private labor market. Unfortunately its a tough sell to corporations who prefer their monopolization and death grip over the labor market, and in turn the politicians bought out by the corporations and the masses brainwashed by them. Former president &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085&quot;&gt;Park Geun-hye&lt;/a&gt; (daughter of a dictator) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39214545&quot;&gt;CEO of Samsung&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085&quot;&gt;in jail&lt;/a&gt; on charges of bribery and corruption. The president before Park was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak&quot;&gt;CEO of Hyundai.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many the idea of a UBI will sound like heresy, but I’ll take it over whatever Korea has.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Peter-thiel-lecture-5-business-strategy-and-monopoly-theory-annotated&quot;&gt;annotated text version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important business idea that people don’t understand is that there are two kinds of businesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses that are perfectly competitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shockingly little in between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is for “losers”, ie. avoid competition and become a monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolies are the best business, and most highly profitable businesses are monopolies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolies lie and claim to not be monopolies, by expanding what they consider their market (Google owns 66.4% of search engine market, but considers itself an “advertising company” or “tech company” to make it seem like less of a monopoly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies in competitive markets lie and claim to be monopolies - unique and special (eg. restaurants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Company&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Cash ($ billions)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gross Margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Apple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Microsoft&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Google&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;65%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Amazon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A business creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X and Y are independent variables.
eg. airlines, solar have low Y, while Google has high Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scientists never make any money. They’re always deluded into thinking that they live in a just universe that will reward them for their work and for their inventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eg. The railroads were incredibly valuable, they mostly just went bankrupt because there was too much competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of Monopoly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economies of Scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a tendency to view increased competition as validation (eg. B-school students trying to be like Mike Milken in 1999, Silicon Valley in 2000, housing and private equity in 2005-7).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Arms Race to the Bottom]]></title><description><![CDATA[The biggest tragedy of our times is that most of us have to spend the majority of our lives doing things we don’t want to do, with…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/arms-race/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/arms-race/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2017 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The biggest tragedy of our times is that most of us have to spend the majority of our lives doing things we don’t want to do, with questionable benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts in school, where students are forced to do homework and learn things they might not be interested in (of course it’s optional, but bad grades -&gt; no job -&gt; unable to provide for oneself / destitution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students must compete against each other for a limited number of slots at prestigious universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at university, students must compete against each other for a limited number of slots at good companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the workforce, employees must compete against each other for promotion and advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job automation is real and already happening. This means the competition is only getting fiercer and fiercer, while wealth is increasingly being hoarded by the top 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we’re in a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium. Like the prisoner’s dilemma, most of us would be better off if we changed the system, but individually our only incentive is to look out for ourselves and make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an arms race to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Z-Indexes in CSS Explained]]></title><description><![CDATA[Z-Index is one of the most confusing and unintuitive properties in CSS, but it’s actually pretty simple once you understand it.Your first…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/z-indexes-explained/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/z-indexes-explained/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2017 12:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Z-Index is one of the most confusing and unintuitive properties in CSS, but it’s actually pretty simple once you understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first instinct is probably to think that you can just set z-index on any element and that that alone is going to determine its stacking order. This is WRONG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all: &lt;strong&gt;z-index only applies to positioned elements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positioned element is an element who’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; property is NOT &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; (eg. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt;). Setting a z-index on an unpositioned element does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If a positioned element has a z-index of X, then all of its children will also be stuck with a z-value of X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the z-index of any child elements all you want, but that won’t do anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: z-value is not an actual CSS term. I only use it because z-index technically defaults to “auto” and can be set to whatever you want, even if it does nothing)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;position: relative; z-index: 6;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;child&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;position: relative: z-index: 7;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;grandchild&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;position: relative; z-index: 9;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The z-value of each of these elements is 6, and there’s no way to change that without modifying the z-index of #parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical terms, &lt;strong&gt;a stacking context is formed when a positioned element has a z-index.&lt;/strong&gt; A stacking context is a single atomic unit composed of a parent along with its children. All elements within a stacking context are bound to the z-value set by the non-root parent (in this case #parent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Non-root just means that it’s not the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. The root &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag technically forms a stacking context, but any z-index on it is meaningless.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can create stacking contexts within stacking contexts, but all child stacking contexts will be bound to the z-value of the outermost (non-root) stacking context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, three stacking contexts are formed, and they’re nested. The z-value of all three contexts is bound to the z-index of #parent, which is 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Stacking Contexts:
#parent (z-value: 6)
  #child
    #grandchild&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that setting the z-index on a positioned element is only one of many ways to create a stacking context. &lt;strong&gt;There are various CSS properties that automatically create a stacking context on an element, regardless of whether or not a z-index is set.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but here are some common properties that automatically create new stacking contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elements with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; value other than “none”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elements with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; value less than 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any element with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform: translateY(50%)&lt;/code&gt; is going to form a new stacking context regardless of whether a z-index has been set on that element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some implications of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must use fixed positioning, make the element as shallow as possible so that it doesn’t accidentally get thrown under another stacking context and bound to that element’s z-index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; to center containers/wrappers if possible (commonly used for vertically centering). The entire container will be bound to the same stacking context, and thus you won’t be able to individually modify the z-index values of any of its children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rgba()&lt;/code&gt; value instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;. This avoids the creation of a stacking context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of this didn’t make sense, just read &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context&quot;&gt;MDN’s guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand z-indexes and stacking contexts, you know something 95% of developers forced to write CSS don’t know, and will no longer have to suffer through migraines figuring out why that z-index isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

Took about a day. Here are some tips, along with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Tree-Shaking?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree-Shaking (popularized by Rollup) is the elimination of unused exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Webpack 2’s Tree Shaking doesn’t seem to eliminate unused exports inside packages — at least in my project (eg. all of Lodash’s functions are included inside my bundle including functions I don’t use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading to Webpack 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/&quot;&gt;Webpack’s official migration guide&lt;/a&gt; is fairly comprehensive so I won’t waste time regurgitating what’s already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In your .babelrc’s es2015 preset, disable modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;presets&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;es2015&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;],&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;presets&amp;quot;: [
  [&amp;quot;es2015&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;loose&amp;quot;: true, &amp;quot;modules&amp;quot;: false}],
  &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will reduce the file size of your outputted JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that you’re not including the “react-hot-loader/babel” Babel plugin in your .babelrc file!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree-shaking won’t work if this plugin is added (wasted a lot of time on this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disabling .babelrc and importing your own config in Webpack (OPTIONAL)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the “babel-loader” section in your Webpack config file to look like this (where .babelrc.js is a JS file containing your .babelrc config)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.js$/,
      use: {
        loader: &amp;#39;babel-loader&amp;#39;,
        options: Object.assign({ babelrc: false }, require(&amp;#39;./babelrc.js&amp;#39;))
      },
      exclude: /node_modules/,
    },
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ignore the Warning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you will get a warning on every Webpack compilation that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(node:35513) DeprecationWarning: loaderUtils.parseQuery() received a non-string value which can be problematic, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/56&quot;&gt;https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/56&lt;/a&gt;
parseQuery() will be replaced with getOptions() in the next major version of loader-utils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ignore it, it’s a problem with one of your Webpack loaders and has nothing to do with you (seems that Webpack will be disabling this warning in a future update).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;main.js went from 342 KB to 325 KB, a 5% decrease in file size. Not exactly drastic, but I’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that about.js went from 1.44 kB to 40.1 kB and the number of chunks were reduced. This is because apparently the minChunkSizePlugin which had minChunkSize=50000 (50kb) wasn’t working before for whatever reason. The tiny &amp;#x3C;2kb chunks were eliminated and merged into about.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in case you were curious what the Webpack 2.0 output is with minChunks disabled, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’d make a table comparing the file sizes, but Medium doesn’t let you make tables…I know, it’s crazy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalog.js went from to 41.9 KB to 36 KB, a 14% file size reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall we saw a slight reduction in file size, but nothing to write home about. That being said, our site is very small. If it were larger, then the file size reduction would’ve been more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this worth the effort and opportunity cost of upgrading? From a business standpoint, probably not. But at least I got this blog post out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 23.8 million managers, first-line supervisors, and administrators in the American workforce in 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers/administrators made up 17.6% of the U.S. workforce and received nearly 30% of total compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This comes out to &lt;strong&gt;1 manager/administrator for every 4.7 employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analysis of well-run companies shows that &lt;strong&gt;it should easily be possible to double the manager/emplooyee ratio&lt;/strong&gt; to 10:1 (freeing up &lt;em&gt;12.5 million workers&lt;/em&gt; to do something more productive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As much as 50% of all internal compliance activity is of questionable value&lt;/strong&gt;. (eg. budgeting, performance review)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-managerial workers spend 16% of their time on internal compliance. This translates to an &lt;strong&gt;annual waste of 8.9 million worker years, or 8.9 million workers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total then, &lt;strong&gt;there are 21.4 million workers (12.5m + 8.9m) creating little to no economic value&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;current economic output could be maintained with 15% fewer people in the labor force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some interesting case studies:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svenska Handelsbanken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its return on equity has surpassed that of its European peers every year since 1971.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently posted industry-beating cost-to-income and loan-loss ratios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the organization of 12,000 associates, there are only three levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating decisions are almost entirely decentralized (counter to conventional banking wisdom).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each branch makes its own loan decisions, sets its own pricing on loans and deposits, controls its own marketing budget, runs its own website (on a shared platform), and serves all customer segments — from individuals to multinationals — within its catchment area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE’s Durham plant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more than 300 technicians and a single supervisor: the plant manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more than twice as productive as its sister plants in GE Aviation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager/employee ratio in these and other vanguard organizations is more than double the U.S. average.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to set up a basic dev environment for web development (mac OSX / Linux)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a tutorial for beginners on how to set up a dev environment on a Mac/OSX (applicable to Linux as well).Text Editor - Sublime TextYou…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/dev-environment-tutorial/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/dev-environment-tutorial/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial for beginners on how to set up a dev environment on a Mac/OSX (applicable to Linux as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Editor - Sublime Text&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably want at least a text editor like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;. Install it, and then set up a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subl&lt;/code&gt; keyword that you can use to launch Sublime from the terminal (eg. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subl .&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subl filename.txt&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;a href=&quot;https://packagecontrol.io/installation&quot;&gt;install the package manager for Sublime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you’ll want to install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme&quot;&gt;nice dark theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminal - iTerm, Oh My Zsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s much better than Mac OSX’s default terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire it up and install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&quot;&gt;Oh My Zsh&lt;/a&gt; via the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sh -c &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make your terminal look prettier and give you some pretty sweet features like telling you what git branch you’re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should set up some aliases to save you some keystrokes. The following let’s you type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git co &amp;lt;branchname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;branchname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git config --global alias.co checkout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video demonstration of this:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot;
          &gt;

            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official Redux examples are very lackluster, so I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JeremyBernier/react-redux-node-boilerplate&quot;&gt;simple blog app&lt;/a&gt; that contains the minimum you’d need for universal/isomorphic rendering, routing (via React-Router), async (via Redux-Thunk, unfortunately you can’t do async out of the box in Redux), meta tags (via React-Helmet), and deploying to production. There’s still work to be done (eg. cleaning up code), but it works and the main boilerplate is implemented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will minimize the amount of time you have to waste writing boring boilerplate code just to get up and running. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adam Grant - Originals (summary)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently listened to an interesting interview of Adam Grant (via James Altucher’s podcast) where he talked about his research in his book…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/adam-grant-originals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/adam-grant-originals/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently listened to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2016/02/adam-grant/&quot;&gt;interesting interview of Adam Grant&lt;/a&gt; (via James Altucher’s podcast) where he talked about his research in his book “Originals”. Adam Grant is the youngest tenured and most highly rated professor at the Wharton School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking criticism, questioning assumptions, and willingness to change beliefs when presented with countering evidence is vital (political correctness and hivemind thinking run completely counter to this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination leads to more creative/original ideas (up to a point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study was done where participants were given an assignment and one group was forced to play Minesweeper for 5 minutes immediately after being assigned the task. That group was most creative. The group forced to play Minesweeper for 5 minutes before given the assignment did not perform any better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be attributed to your brain unconsciously processing information in the background of your mind. It’s just like how information is often retained better when you learn it right before sleeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who keep their day jobs while trying to start a business are 33% less likely to fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First mover advantage isn’t reflected in statistics. 47% of first-movers fail, compared to 8% of late entrants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wide breadth of knowledge is more conducive to coming up with original ideas than depth. Innovation often comes from applying something from one field to a totally different field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depth of knowledge gives one good intuition within one’s own field, but does not apply well outside that field (eg. Steve Jobs championing the segway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid of failure. Volume of ideas/attempts is critical. You can fail by trying and failing or not trying at all. Given that most regrets are from inaction, it makes more sense to be the former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society, we’re most definitely not optimizing for creative and original thinking. We place so much value on conformity and robot-like depth of knowledge that we shun those who may be most likely to offer the most innovative ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, schools and companies tend to reward the most risk-averse and conformist indoctrinated individuals while punishing the rest. This leads to a very one-dimensional labor force, unable to think outside the confines of their own boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely due to the increased competition and cutthroat nature of education/labor markets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to work efficiently and stop wasting your time]]></title><description><![CDATA[Productivity, or the rate at which you get stuff done, is highly variable.

When I’m “in the zone”, I’d estimate conservatively that I’m 4x more productive than when I’m least productive (eg. tired, bored, unfocused).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it’s not possible to constantly work at 100% productivity. We’re not robots, and our brains need rest. It’s inevitable that at some point, your ability to come up with creative ideas and be intensely focused will diminish (note: I’m referring to real, creative work, not rote/repetitive menial labor tasks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to this point of diminished productivity, you’re better off taking a break because that allows you to replenish your batteries quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend 3 hours working at 20% capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a one hour break, then spend 2 hours working at 60% capacity (or intersperse that one hour break over those 3 hours)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case 1, your output is 3 * .2 = .6
In case 2, your output is 2 * .6 = 1.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not only did you accomplish twice as much in case 2, but you worked 33% less hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the ridiculousness of 9-5 office jobs and the giant elephant in the room. If your work involves any kind of creativity or nontrivial thinking, you could get the same or even more  work done in a fraction of the time if you optimized your work habits. But good luck selling that to your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it can be difficult to gauge your rate of productivity at any moment in time. But if you make a conscious effort to do so, you will improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend doing something that you want to do, but here are some ideas on both a micro and macro scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gym&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do productive things outside your task at hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socialize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had the habit of working too much, even when I’m not being efficient. I’d tell myself to suck it up and just keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense this is admirable, and to a certain extent it is a good thing in that it builds discipline and expands my boundaries. But there’s a clear point after which it becomes counterproductive, and I crossed that line way too many times. The result is that I’ve accomplished significantly less than my potential, while wasting significantly more hours “working” - time that could’ve been spent exposing myself to random opportunities or simply enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society we glamorize working way too much. It’s almost a status symbol to brag about how long you’ve worked. It’s utterly ridiculous. Work is simply a means to an end, and has diminishing returns. If you spend 10 hours doing something that could’ve been done in 4, you’re just an idiot who doesn’t value his time (by extension, your life). There’s nothing admirable about that. If you were truly devoted, then you would’ve optimized your time to work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to your rate of productivity. It is extremely variable.

Allowing employees the flexibility to work on their own schedule would increase output, increase efficiency, and make employees happier. It’s win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole “work X hours/day” idea is a relic of a former era where “hours worked” was a decent measure of output for most jobs, which tended to be more of the mindless clock-in/clock-out type work (eg. working on an assembly line, receptionist, retail). But for any job where the work is predominantly mental rather than manual, mechanical, or shift-based, “hours worked” is a horrible proxy for output. Unfortunately workplace culture hasn’t adapted to accommodate the evolving nature of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an employee going into the office in the morning, knowing that no matter how hard you work that you’ll still have to be there until 5pm means you’re naturally going to expand your working time to fill your allotted time. This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s law.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, work involving concentrated mental effort and creative thinking tends to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt;, which states that 80% of the output comes from 20% of the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pareto Principle, or 80/20 rule: 80% of the output comes from 20% of the effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s practically impossible to work at full mental capacity for more than 1 or 2 hours straight, let alone 8. It’s more efficient to take a break every once in a while in order to reset, because otherwise your focus and efficiency will tend to slowly taper off and face diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everyone works on the same schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any job where the majority of the work is done solo, the strict enforcing of an 8-hour stretch of mandated working hours is incredibly inefficient. Some people are night owls and work best at night. If they can get more work done at night and struggle to wake up early, why should they have to sacrifice their mental alertness, health, and productivity for the day just so they can make it to the office by some arbitrary cutoff point? I can’t tell you how many times I would’ve been so much more productive had I been able to sleep in after a late night, yet had to wake up prematurely just so that I could make it to the office on time and be totally unproductive all day due to sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a thought experiment, imagine some famous scientist is your employee, and his task is to find a cure for cancer. If you were his manager, do you believe that forcing him to work from 9-5, 5 days/week would make him most productive? What if he was up the night before until 3am working, or just out drinking with some scientist buddies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a job should be the exchange of work for compensation. &lt;strong&gt;Effort is meaningless. All that matters are results.&lt;/strong&gt; For a mental job, hours worked is an extremely rough measure of effort, and not a measure of output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do managers continue to mandate their employees work from 9-5, and severely punish them from showing up 5-10 minutes late (which in an 8 hour day is insignificant)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It mostly has to do with tradition and inability to think outside the status quo, but it’s also because managers are often clueless on how to gauge the work of their employees. A non-technical manager overseeing a technical employee has no idea how long tasks are supposed to take, so the ignorant manager uses “hours of ass-in-chair” as a proxy for estimating output. And like I said, this is a horrendous measure of output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it ever going to change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a win-win, it hasn’t been changing because (1) managers tend to be old, traditional, and risk-averse, meaning they won’t make the effort to challenge the status quo (2) employers have an extraordinary amount of leverage in today’s economy. The job market is extremely competitive, and employees are at the mercy of employers to survive. As a result, all but the most rock-star of employees have no leverage to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at some point we institute a basic income, then that would most certainly lead to change because it would tip the negotiating power towards the laborers (since laborers would no longer be dependent on their employers to not starve).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I went from a 3.0 student to a 4.0 student]]></title><description><![CDATA[Most people who struggle in school despite working hard simply aren’t making the effort to fully understand the material on an intuitive…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/straight_as/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/straight_as/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Most people who struggle in school despite working hard simply aren’t making the effort to fully understand the material on an intuitive level. Rote memorization is not learning. You need to make the effort to actually understand the material. Anybody who does this will not get poor grades (unless maybe you’re taking a PhD course in theoretical physics). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common problem is that people often don’t realize when they don’t understand something. Trying to explain something out loud like you’re explaining it to somebody else is the best and easiest way to gauge whether or not you actually understand something. If you fail, you’ll know you don’t get it. If you succeed, then you might notice that you understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from getting mediocre grades to straight A’s, and I attribute that mostly to putting in the effort to intuitively understand the material, and trying to explain things out loud was a technique I regularly used to ensure that I understood the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I majored in math. What worked for me is unfortunately going to be less applicable to memorization-heavy subjects like biology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend checking out Cal Newport’s blog for more advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to work smarter. One mistake I made was just working too much, often inefficiently. All hours of work aren’t equal. Make sure you’re working efficiently so that you have more time to do other things. Don’t lose sight of your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Javascript Absurdities]]></title><description><![CDATA[Javascript is a funky language.

Here are some obvious design flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1520800/why-regexp-with-global-flag-in-javascript-give-wrong-results&quot;&gt;Regex &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; method is inconsistent when global flag is set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var pattern = /hi/g;
pattern.test(&amp;#39;hi&amp;#39;); //true
pattern.test(&amp;#39;hi&amp;#39;); //false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today at work I spent hours on a witch hunt trying to pinpoint the cause of a bug that was delaying a production release. It ended up coming down to this absurd Javascript quirk within a single “if” statement inside a portion of code that hadn’t been touched in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. null and undefined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having separate null and undefined types just adds unnecessary confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to check whether variable is null or undefined is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if (varname == null)&lt;/code&gt;. Using the triple equals (which is preferred in almost every other situation) will not catch both types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. typeof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;typeof [] //&amp;quot;object&amp;quot;
typeof null //&amp;quot;object&amp;quot;
typeof NaN //&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wtf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. NaN != NaN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check if a value is NaN, you have to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isNaN()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; inside a function is an “Array-like” Object instead of an Array&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ridiculous. The convention is to use something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)&lt;/code&gt; to convert the “Array-like Object” into an Array (and of course that’s totally clear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Checking deep nested objects is a hassle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to check if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;obj.prop1.thing2.key3 === &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;? If obj.prop1.thing2 is not an object, then a TypeError is thrown and your code will abort. So you have to check `obj &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; obj.prop1 &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; obj.prop1.thing2 &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; obj.prop1.thing2.key3 === “hello”. Or you can use a try/catch function or use a utility function (eg. using Lodash or writing your own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Math.abs(null) === 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;null &amp;#x3C;= 0 //true
null &amp;#x3C; 0 //false
null == 0 //false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17106681/parseint-vs-unary-plus-when-to-use-which&quot;&gt;No clear sane way to parse integers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parseInt() is not guaranteed to default to base 10, so you have to explicitly pass in 10 as the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;parseInt(&amp;#39;2424blahblahblah&amp;#39;, 10) //NaN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ”+” sign is commonly used to parse integers, but is a little different and has its own pitfalls as well. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+&amp;#39;&amp;#39; === 0 //true
+true === 1 //true
+false === 0 //true

+&amp;#39;2e3&amp;#39; === 2000 //true
parseInt(&amp;#39;2e3&amp;#39;, 10) === 2 //true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[1,2,3].map(x =&amp;gt; {hi: ‘ok’}) //[undefined, undefined, undefined]
[1,2,3].map(x =&amp;gt; ({hi: ‘ok’})) // [Object. Object. Object][1,2,3].map(x =&amp;gt; {return {hi: &amp;#39;ok’}}) // [Object. Object. Object]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tips for developing a 2D HTML5 Canvas Javascript game]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently had the pleasure of creating a 2D HTML5 Canvas game from scratch.

Here are some tips and takeaways that might save you some time if you intend to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; for your game loop. Here’s a polyfill you can use for cross-browser support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.requestAnimationFrame = window.requestAnimationFrame
    || window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame
    || window.mozRequestAnimationFrame
    || window.msRequestAnimationFrame
    || function(callback) { return setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60); };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make sure your game engine takes into account the varying time &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;delta&lt;/code&gt; (because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; does not guarantee a consistent FPS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not take into account the varying time &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;delta&lt;/code&gt; between consecutive iterations of your game loop when using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt;, then your game or simulation will run differently each time. This is bad. (Also, see #5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;performance.now()&lt;/code&gt; for precision timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a polyfill you can use in case the browser doesn’t support the performance API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.performance = window.performance || {};
window.performance.now = (function() {
  return performance.now       ||
         performance.mozNow    ||
         performance.msNow     ||
         performance.oNow      ||
         performance.webkitNow ||
         function() { return new Date().getTime(); };
})();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. When using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height)&lt;/code&gt;, make sure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are integers to avoid blurriness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fillRect(x, y, width, height)&lt;/code&gt; renders a rectangle on the Canvas. The problem is that when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is not an integer, the rectangle is going to look blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution? Ensure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are always integers by rounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not afraid of modifying native prototypes, here’s a function you can define that could be used instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fillRect()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillRectClean = function (x, y, width, height) {
  this.fillRect(Math.round(x), Math.round(y), width, height);
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don’t attempt to build your own physics engine from scratch if you intend on actually finishing your game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate the amount of work involved in building a physics engine. Basic tile-based collision isn’t a big deal (eg. 2D Pokemon game), but anything more complex (eg. Angry Birds) is going to take a lot more work than you probably think it will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting whether rectangles and circles are intersecting is easy. But what if the two objects are moving so fast that they go through each other and never technically intersect (solution: continuous collision detection or limiting velocities)? What if you have a million objects and performance is taking a severe hit (ever heard of a QuadTree)? Detecting collisions is one thing, but the resolution itself is even harder and requires a good understanding of physics (do the terms impulse resolution and collision normal mean anything to you?). Oh and what if you want to add rotation into the mix? What about more complex shapes like polygons, both concave and convex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re smart and willing to dive deep into physics and computer science, then sure you’ll be able to figure it out because these are solved problems with resources out there to help you learn. But if your goal is to make a game, then you’ll save yourself a whole lot of time and headache by not reinventing the wheel and just using an existing battle-tested physics engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not convinced, take a look at the source code of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/liabru/matter-js&quot;&gt;Matter.js&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea of what’s involved. And keep in mind that Matter.js is still in alpha status and has bugs (eg. in the “Mixed Shapes” demo you can sling objects through the walls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. You should probably just use Unity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but you’re probably just better off using Unity. Making a game is an extremely daunting task, and Unity simplifies things tremendously, allowing you to focus exclusively on the content of the game without being bogged down by extraneous things (eg. game engine design, physics, making a level editor, handling sprites, sound, etc.). And Unity enables you to export to any platform (iOS, Android, Oculus, consoles, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to stick with HTML5/Javascript, you’d save a ton of time by using a framework like &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who prefers Open Source and enjoys the process of building the game engine more than building the actual game itself, it pains me to say “just use Unity”. But for the majority of games out there that don’t require anything too crazy, using an established game engine like Unity or Unreal is probably your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by all means build your own game engine from scratch for the sake of intellectual curiosity. Just realize that you’re probably reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Weekend in Seoul and Tokyo]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently spent 2.5 days in Seoul and 1.5 days in Tokyo on an impromptu vacation.

Had the time of my life, and was blown away by how much more modern the cities feel (particularly Seoul) and how different their cultures are from America. Tokyo in particular blew my mind, and I’ve decided that I need to live there at some point in my life (I’m a bit biased because I can speak the language though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Three.js, the THREE.Geometry class has a merge() function that allows you to merge two geometries. Below is a function that will take in an array of meshes and return a THREE.Geometry object with the geometries combined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;function mergeMeshes (meshes) {
  var combined = new THREE.Geometry();

  for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; meshes.length; i++) {
    meshes[i].updateMatrix();
    combined.merge(meshes[i].geometry, meshes[i].matrix);
  }

  return combined;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the function in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var meshes = [], geometry, material, mesh;

geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(50,50,50);
material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({color: 0xCC0000});
mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
meshes.push(mesh);

mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
mesh.position.x = 100;
meshes.push(mesh);

//merge both geometries
geometry = mergeMeshes(meshes);
mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, the geometries you combine have to be regular geometries and not BufferGeometries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately if you merge a bunch of adjacent cubes, the faces they share will still exist. So if you merge 3x3x3 cubes, it’s going to look like one big box on the outside, but on the inside you’re still going to see all those little individual cubes. It is possible to remove them, but as far as I know you have to remove each face individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways I only wrote this because all the info on Google seems to be outdated (THREE.GeometryUtils.merge has been deprecated)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making a 3D Game]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve decided I’m going to make a video game.It’s going to be 3D and use WebGL and Three.js so that it can load in the browser without any…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/making-a-game/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/making-a-game/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided I’m going to make a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be 3D and use WebGL and Three.js so that it can load in the browser without any plugins. I’ll probably utilize an existing open source physics engine at some point, but for the time being I’m doing all my simple collision detection with raycasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Three.js makes things magnitudes of order simpler than using raw WebGL, it still does very little for you in the context of creating a video game. Also I have no background in 3D modeling and video game development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My objective isn’t merely to make a game, but to also learn how everything works in 3D development. I want to know the math, the proper collision detection algorithms to use, how to organize my code into clean decoupled stateless modules, performance optimization, artificial intelligence, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is a daunting undertaking on my end which will probably require hundreds if not thousands of hours of work outside my day job. I know that I’ll inevitably face a period of hardship where I’ll feel overwhelmed and tempted to give up, which is why I’m writing this post to keep track of my progress and hold myself accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are very irrational. It is very much not a human instinct to optimize your life for the long term as opposed to chasing short term highs. This is my commitment to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to update this post with a daily log of my progress. Also I hope to have a link up shortly to a live version of whatever I’ve done so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/22-26&lt;/strong&gt; - Created basic 3D world with FPS view, ability to walk on non-level terrain (eg. walk up ramps) via raycasting, ability to select objects with raycasting, ability to shoot properly rotated cylinders in any direction (had to brush up on my freaking trigonometry for this), audio visualizations via Web Audio API, brushed up on basic fragment/vertex shader workings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/27&lt;/strong&gt; - Added Collada model loading. Took longer than expected due to error being thrown by global variables. Submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/6747&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; (my first PR to an open source project btw).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals for tomorrow: make it so I can load multiple Collada models (yea…it’s not built into the library), learn 3D modeling and figure out the best way to create buildings and walls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/28&lt;/strong&gt; - Learned about BufferGeometries, how to merge geometries, and how to delete faces. Started making the map editor, using the voxel painter example as a foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I worked all day, felt like 80% of my work was done at night (stayed up till 4am) because I was much more focused. Maybe I should only work at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/29&lt;/strong&gt; - First day back to work. Didn’t get any 3D stuff done because I spent my after-work time finishing up and launching the new upgraded jbernier.com.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable accomplishments of the day include eating both a Chipotle burrito and a Mighty Quinn’s brisket for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OFF TOPIC:&lt;/em&gt; It bothers me that most restaurants skimp you on the meat. My Chipotle burrito had a pathetic amount of meat on it relative to everything else. Meat is the cornerstone of every meal. Everything else is a supplement. When asked what’s for dinner tonight, the first thing you say isn’t “broccoli”, it’s “steak”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does only 7% of my Chipotle burrito consist of steak? I can get a ton of salsa, peppers, onions, lettuce, corn, and guacamole, but only 10 little cubes of steak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided I’m going to try to write every day, even if it’s just a little blurb. That way I can look back to every single day of my life and recall what I did on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry guys, I ended up abandoning this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the unfinished 3d stuff I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jbernier.com/projects&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main takeaway? &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8000/2d-html5-canvas-javascript-game-tips/&quot;&gt;Just use Unity (or any other game framework)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this was a great learning experience and I had fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[2 Weeks in Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently spent 16 days traveling solo around Europe.

I visited Stockholm, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, and Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t bring my laptop with me, and “lost” my phone on day 2 to a couple muggers (more on that later) so to me it was almost like a full technological detox since I usually spend the majority of my time in front of a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this trip I had never been to Europe (aside from Paris when I was ~10, but that doesn’t count) and hadn’t left the country in something ridiculous like 10 years, so this trip was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did absolutely no planning aside from booking my plane tickets and my hostels in Stockholm and Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a detailed account of my experience: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeremybernier/2-weeks-in-europe-ea70dd1eb0af&quot;&gt;Read the full post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One Language To Rule Them All (no, not Javascript)]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the web world, frameworks and languages come and go so quickly that it’s nearly impossible to keep up.

&lt;p&gt;Backbone was the hot thing one year, followed by Angular the following year, followed by React the next. It didn’t take long for Ruby on Rails to be eclipsed by Node. Every week a new flux framework comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, like trading stocks, it’s pretty much impossible to predict the future. But here are my thoughts (which in 6 months may be totally different).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that Node has its place in the foreseeable future for webapp development, largely because it allows the developer to share code on the client and server. Javascript has become the hot language and will probably stay that way in web world for a while, mostly because it’s the only language that browsers can read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Javascript is not the end all be all. It has warts, and makes it all too easy to write terrible code. ES6 is a huge improvement, but it’s still Javascript. Typescript adds static typing, but it’s still Javascript. And Javascript will never change at a fast enough pace or on a fundamental level because standards committees are slow and risk-averse (not wanting to break the web and all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that coding in vanilla Javascript will eventually be superseded by a better language(s) that compiles to Javascript (eg. Clojurescript), and ultimately a language that also compiles to HTML and CSS as well (eg. Elm). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That language will most likely be functional, declarative, and reactive. I don’t think that the fundamental principles behind increasingly popular technologies like React and Clojurescript are just a fad. Functional programming is getting more popular because it leads to more resilient code. The future is declarative, allowing the programmer to simply specify what he/she wants without having to be bogged down by unimportant details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML, CSS, and Javascript were built 20 years ago. The web has evolved considerably since then, and yet the fundamental trinity of web technologies haven’t changed much. CSS still sucks (even with Sass) and is not totally decoupled from HTML (which uses XML…). No amount of monkey patching and trying to make it as expressive as a language without it really being a language is going to fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either browsers will change the technologies of the web, or we’re going to work around it. The latter is far more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we’re going to have &lt;strong&gt;one language to rule them all&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s going to make web development a hell of a lot easier and less error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of seeing Jeremy Ashkenas (creator of Backbone, Underscore, and Coffeescript) give a talk at Genius a couple months ago, and he basically said the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing we have to a unified web language right now is Elm, a young language created by a 25 year old kid during his senior year at Havard. It’s still very premature, but I think it’s a preview of what the future is going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[School is a Crime Against Humanity]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you agree with me that school is a giant waste of time, then it follows that school is one of the biggest crimes against humanity if you…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/school-crime-humanity/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/school-crime-humanity/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you agree with me that school is a giant waste of time, then it follows that school is one of the biggest crimes against humanity if you take into account all the hours of our lives it collectively wastes. Time is our most valuable asset, and school robs us of our youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember 99% of anything I learned in school. I was forced to read boring novels and complete pointless assignments, but never taught how to be independent or autodidactic. So what was the point of all that suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is a relic of a prior era where information was only accessible through books and the minds of the educated. Now that we have the internet, this is no longer the case. Yet modern education has not adapted to the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that school as an institution shouldn’t exist (though maybe it shouldn’t), I’m saying that it’s extraordinarily inefficient at accomplishing more than being a combination of a glorified daycare and prison. Although it can give poor kids a chance in life, it can also kill the dreams of those who don’t fit its mold (what if John Carmack hadn’t dropped out?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s take a look at the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Middle/High school&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a typical day for a student at my public high school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:00am Wake up at the ass crack of dawn to make it to the bus stop because the bus leaves at 6:30am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:45am Go to class and sit/sleep in boring lecture after boring lecture until 2:45pm when classes finish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:00pm Go to some after-school club/sport, because you won’t get into a good college without extracurricular activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:00pm Get home and get started on the 2+ hours of homework due tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some problems with school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced to take every stupid pointless class imaginable. You’re interested in computer science? Too bad, you still have to read Shakespeare and write that 10 page paper on the Ottoman Empire. Needless to say, I don’t remember anything about Shakespeare or the Ottoman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grades are based on how well you regurgitate trivia-style info on exams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody including (and especially) the straight-A students copy each others’ homework. Nobody actually cares about the material. After the exam, nobody remembers anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting from junior year, half the courses you take are college courses (AP or IB). I have to take college course to get into college?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need straight-A’s to get into a top-50 school. 50 years ago you could get into Brown with a 3.6 and a good essay, now you need a 5.3 and an A in AP Calculus to get into University of Virginia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cafeteria food is disturbingly unhealthy (and we wonder why America is fat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;College&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you actually have a bit of freedom in the courses you pick and can schedule them at any time you want! Feels like heaven compared to high school! But in reality, college still sucks (at least the learning aspect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re still forced to take pointless classes, sit through boring lectures (the professor is an attention whore who grades you on your attendance to his stupid lectures that you stopped going to because they weren’t helpful), spend hours completing dumb assignments and memorizing trivia questions for the exam, etc. You need to carefully plan your classes so that they are easy enough to get an A, yet rigorous-sounding enough to where you’d be taken seriously if a grad school or an employer were to audit your transcripts. Everyone pretends to care about their classes to look intelligent and fit in, but in reality nobody really cares because school does a great job of turning students off to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past the degree was enough to get a job. Then employers started realizing that college graduates were useless, and so they demanded that graduates have a summer internship prior to graduation. And now to even land that coveted summer internship before you senior year, you need prior internship experience. So you’re basically expected to intern every summer after freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you have to go into &lt;a href=&quot;/student-loans-tax-middle-class&quot;&gt;six figures of debt&lt;/a&gt; to get a college education at a public school. That includes the cost to pay for $500 textbooks that are so expensive despite the fact that the information is 100+ years old because the textbook companies rearrange the chapters every year and call it a new edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post-Graduation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get a job in a field completely unrelated to your major&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get a job in a field related to your major, but realize that you don’t know anything relevant to the real world and your entire education was useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is education so ineffective?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curriculums are ancient and divorced from reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecturing is an inefficient way to teach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. Lectures are not only ineffective, but incredibly boring. It’s just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/10/24/teacher-spends-two-days-as-a-student-and-is-shocked-at-what-she-learned/&quot;&gt;not possible to sit and actively pay attention while someone talks to themself for over an hour.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forces everyone to learn at the same pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional classroom, everyone has to learn at the same pace. This leaves “slow” students behind and bores bright students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of resources like KhanAcademy are that they allow the learner to learn at his/her pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests are based on “trivia”-style questions, which are obsolete in a world where you can Google anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College doesn’t teach you how to think independently. People often say that college teaches you “how to learn”. In my experience, that couldn’t be further from the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a college class, the entire curriculum is laid out for you. You’re given solved problems in a textbook that have an answer key. Don’t know how to do something? Read Chapter 5. If all else fails, you have a professor and TA willing to hold your hand through anything. In STEM classes, there’s typically always a correct answer or correct way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of my first full-time job, I was told to learn X, Y, and Z. It was my responsibility to teach myself through whatever means necessary because my job depended on it. Sure he was willing to guide me or help out when possible, but he didn’t have the time to hand hold me through everything. I basically had to Google, read books, post on forums, and learn by “doing”. Some of the stuff I had to learn was so cutting edge that there weren’t really textbooks or courses on them anyways (I wasn’t working on rocket science or anything, technology just changes fast). And to top it all off, my supervisor was also completely self-taught, having spent 5+ years in school studying architecture of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t teach someone who doesn’t want to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students, especially prior to college, don’t care about 99% of what they’re being taught. This means that they’re not only miserable, but inevitably going to forget the material after the final exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutthroat focus on GPA is unhealthy and disincentivizes taking challenging courses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewards conformity and doing what you’re told rather than creativity and thinking outside the box (indoctrination)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I guess this may not be a bad thing from the perspective of a corporation looking to hire drones willing to work long hours taking orders and working on mindless tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re working on imaginary problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue about the benefits of college all you want, but it doesn’t mean much without factoring in the opportunity cost. Sure your basket weaving degree might’ve made you a better basket weaver, but could your time have been better spent doing something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I majored in math. Math lectures are especially dumb because they’re typically taught straight out of the book (which I loved because I didn’t have to go to class).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet makes modern education as we know it obsolete. It’s just a matter of time before teachers (at least at the collegiate level) get replaced by software. There’s no reason to have a million teachers simultaneously giving chemistry 101 lectures every year when you can just have one teacher record a single video once. I don’t mean to demean the work of teachers (most other occupations will be automated away in the future as well), but that’s just the reality of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its failure to prepare students for the workforce, college education continues to remain mandatory because employers still demand it. Until employers stop demanding that applicants have degrees, college education will remain mandatory for those of us who aren’t Mark Zuckerbergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I vowed to never forget the pain and suffering of having to sit in boring lecture after lecture, completing bullsh!t assignment after assignment. It never made sense to me that anyone who had gone through the same suffering wouldn’t speak out against it. After graduating and experiencing the real world, the whole college experience appears even more absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is a prison. It punishes those with free spirits and rewards those who conform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really start learning until I started doing things outside of the ivory tower, like interning and working. This is largely because for once I was working on real problems, and thus actually cared about what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again I studied math and work as a web developer. I’m sure there are fields where the four years of education are helpful (medicine maybe?). But for most of us, college is largely time that could’ve been better spent doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Student loans are a 10–50% tax on children of the lower/middle class]]></title><description><![CDATA[We don’t complain about primary or secondary education being free, yet somehow the topic of whether higher education should be made…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/student-loans-tax-middle-class/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/student-loans-tax-middle-class/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We don’t complain about primary or secondary education being free, yet somehow the topic of whether higher education should be made affordable is extremely controversial in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s pretty reasonable to say that a higher education from a public school shouldn’t cost $108k given that a degree in today’s economy is mandatory to landing a job that doesn’t destine you to a life of wage-slavery and living paycheck to paycheck (eg. flipping burgers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education is a positive externality that benefits not only the educated, but society as a whole&lt;/strong&gt; (though some disciplines are more obviously beneficial than others). Having better doctors and engineers benefits not only those individuals, but everyone they serve. Educated people make better decisions, whether that be at their jobs or in the voting booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free education is paramount to a society grounded on meritocracy and equal-opportunity for all.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s the great equalizer. But when your ability to get an education becomes subject not to your own merits, but to the finances of your parents, society starts to resemble more of a plutocracy than a meritocracy (not to mention America is one of the only countries where universities give priority to “legacies”, or children of alumni. One third of the kids in the recent Harvard class are legacies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are we putting people into debt slavery for pursuing an education? Isn’t education something that should be encouraged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much does a public education cost?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in northern Virginia and went to a public high school. At my school, the “smart kids” with straight-A’s typically went to the University of Virginia. It’s the #2 ranked public school in the country (according to U.S. News’ 2015 rankings) and costs less than half what an elite private school would cost (which are practically impossible to get into nowadays without being a legacy or sacrificing anything resembling a youth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/university-of-virginia&quot;&gt;The annual cost to attend UVA is $27,126&lt;/a&gt;, which amounts to $108,504 for a four-year Bachelor’s degree (the minimum requirement in today’s job market). And that doesn’t include the interest accrued on any student loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average UVA graduate makes $54,100. For someone without the privilege of having parents pay for his/her education, this amounts to a debt/income ratio of 2.0. Monthly loan payments would eat up about half of that student’s starting salary under the standard repayment plan (10 years). Switching to the recently introduced “Pay-As-You-Earn” program would cap those payments to 10% of disposable income, but then the graduate would most likely be stuck making monthly loan payments for 20 years, after which he/she will have to pay a “tax bomb” on the remaining forgiven balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most absurd part is that unlike any other type of loan (eg. credit card debt, mortgages), &lt;strong&gt;student loans can’t be discharged in bankruptcy&lt;/strong&gt; (thanks to the Republicans in 2005). So if for whatever reason you can’t afford to pay (say: you can’t find a job), you’re essentially fucked and the government will garnish your wages and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-12/more-elderly-americans-are-struggling-with-student-loan-debt&quot;&gt;Social Security payments&lt;/a&gt; (if that’s even still around by the time we’re old enough to receive them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is debt slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student loans are effectively a tax on children of the lower and middle classes&lt;/strong&gt;, those who stand to benefit the most from education in the first place. College is supposed to be the great equalizer, but it’s penalizing the very people who need it the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have $120,000 in federal student loans at a 7% interest rate from getting a Bachelor’s from Virginia Tech and a Master’s from Columbia University. My monthly payments under the standard 10-year plan amount to $1,373/month. I’m fortunate enough to make six-figures (pre-tax), but that still means one-fourth of my paycheck is going to student loan payments. And my father has been helping me out with the payments on my undergrad loans. If not for that, my debt would probably be at least $20–40k higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t realistically afford to buy a house or start a family anytime soon. I’ve delayed my retirement by at least 5 years. I can’t really take a year off to travel the world or make music while I’m in the prime of my life because the interest on the debt is too high. I’ll be stuck making these payments for the rest of my 20’s and probably most of my 30’s too. I feel like an indentured servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m one of the lucky ones. I have a job and make decent money. Most college graduates aren’t making as much, if they’re even able to find jobs in the first place. And the problem is only going to get worse because colleges aren’t adapting to the workforce and technology is automating jobs away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generation of Indentured Servants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MEHOINUSA672N&quot;&gt;Household income adjusted for inflation has declined ~8.8% since 1999&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s around the same level as it was 20 years ago. But if you factor in that 10–50% of our salaries (“our” being those of us born to lower/middle class parents) are going to student loan payments, &lt;strong&gt;we’re making 10–50% less than what income statistics report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a fundamental problem with the system. &lt;a href=&quot;/school-crime-humanity&quot;&gt;The university itself is outdated and largely a waste of time for most people&lt;/a&gt;, yet we’re still forced to go and pay for it because employers demand it. Until employers stop demanding degrees (or entrepreneurialism becomes easily accessible to all — highly unlikely), that’s not going to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can we start fixing this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, anyone can complain about a problem, but the more difficult part is coming up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the entire system as it is is unsustainable and needs to change. But that’s a topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ll close this post with some simple suggestions that would be more realistic in terms of getting congressional approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the #1 most urgent priority. It doesn’t matter if there’s a 5-year post-graduation minimum attached to it, making student debt impossible to discharge is completely unethical. If you lend money, then you assume the risk of not getting your money back. If Greece can default on its debts, students should be able to as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me pessimistic about the odds of this going through Congress is that the U.S. government makes a ton of money off student loans. There is over $1 trillion in student debt, and if everyone were to default, the government would be losing out on a lot of profits (on the backs of the middle-class).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t matter. Debt should always be dischargeable in bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Lower interest rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rates average around 7%. It’s absurd that the government is profiting off student loans via interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Make interest payments tax deductible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s already a Student Loan Interest Deduction, but it’s capped at $2,500/year and limited to those earning less than $75,000/year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage interest is tax deductible. Why not student loans? Is getting an education not as fundamental to the “American Dream” as owning a house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Lower the cost of education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1950 tuition was so cheap that students virtually had free education, whether that be in-state or out-of-state, public or private. Yet here we are 65 years later and the same education costs as much as a house. There’s no reason that a society as technologically advanced as ours can’t provide free or near-free education, a service that we were able to provide 65 years ago before the computer and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could start by cutting out the administrative fat, starting with reducing the outrageous compensation packages of university presidents. It’s not just private universities that are paying their presidents $2m+/year with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyulocal.com/is-john-sextons-compensation-even-more-than-we-thought-9a72aa810fc1&quot;&gt;$800k/year retirement packages&lt;/a&gt;, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurensonnenberg/2017/07/17/the-top-paid-public-university-presidents/#4ab43099114c&quot;&gt;public universities as well.&lt;/a&gt; Outrageous for universities, especially since they’re funded by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textbook prices are also notably inflated. Every year the publishers rearrange the chapters and call it a new edition to slap a premium price tag on it, despite the fact that the material itself often hasn’t changed in 200+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually every European country has managed to provide free or cheap university education. There’s no reason we can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Lower the price of public education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/&quot;&gt;it would only cost ~$40 billion to pay the tuition of every single public school student in America&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously $40 billion is a lot of money, but in the context of the U.S.’s $3.9 trillion budget, it’d amount to about 1%. And perhaps this could be funded in part by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/04/03/ivy-league-colleges-collecting-more-than-41-billion-in-taxpayer-money-report-says.html&quot;&gt;$41 billion in tax breaks Ivy League universities receive every year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already pay for colleges through our tax dollars. If the government is going to continue subsidizing public and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/10/07/The-Rich-University-The-Mother-of-all-Tax-Breaks&quot;&gt;private schools&lt;/a&gt;, then that money needs to be conditional on schools charging their students less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the generation of indentured servants. I hope the old farts in Congress can muster up the courage to do something (if they’re even aware of the severity of the problem, since college was so much cheaper in their day, and half of them are millionaires anyways). Too many Americans are unnecessarily slaving away and even committing suicide due to our own government’s incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lectures Suck]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today at work the whole office had to sit down in an auditorium and listen to an outside consultant lecture us on the “Agile methodology…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/lectures-suck/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/lectures-suck/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today at work the whole office had to sit down in an auditorium and listen to an outside consultant lecture us on the “Agile methodology”. It was like being in school all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first couple hours or so, I was pretty engaged. But then my attention started to wander. It became a massive effort to pay attention. She told us we weren’t allowed to look at our phones or laptops, so I resisted the urge. By 1pm, I couldn’t take it anymore and was fully immersed in my phone. At 3pm, my full concentration was now directed towards trying to keep myself from dozing off. By 4pm I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of grad school. In grad school, I rarely went to lectures because I rarely found them helpful and they were next to impossible to stay awake in. So sitting in the auditorium at work, my initial instinct was to get up and leave at that point where I knew I could no longer focus and thus there was no point in me being there. But it might’ve looked bad if the 2-month old employee just suddenly walked out of the company-wide meeting in front of the CTO, Chief Product Officer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F*ck lectures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/10/24/teacher-spends-two-days-as-a-student-and-is-shocked-at-what-she-learned/&quot;&gt;It’s not physically possible for a human to pay attention for 7 hours straight&lt;/a&gt;, even with a lunch break in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what high school students have to do everyday. It’s torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lectures are not the most effective form of teaching for every person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people learn better by doing.&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to someone talk about theory has its merits, but nothing is ever really hammered home until you actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99% of the time I prefer reading to watching lectures because reading allows me to learn at my own pace. I find it much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never watched a lecture on Youtube and not increased the playback speed to 2x (the max). Most lecturers talk slowly and blabber on about nonsense. My attention span is too limited for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In primary school, we classify kids with ADD who can’t sit still and listen for 7 consecutive hours as having “learning disabilities”. What if that’s just not how we were meant to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tobi.lutke.com/blogs/news/11280301-the-apprentice-programmer&quot;&gt;Here’s an article&lt;/a&gt; I read on my phone today by one of the co-founders of Shopify who suffered from the same problem as me while in school. Apparently his “learning disabilities” didn’t prevent him from creating an e-commerce platform with over $7 billion in gross merchandise volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacking Twitter (how I got 1,000 followers in one week)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last night I was bored and looking for a side project to work on to help improve my Javascript skills for my new job (just finished week…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/hacking-twitter/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/hacking-twitter/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 12:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last night I was bored and looking for a side project to work on to help improve my Javascript skills for my new job (just finished week 1), so I made a Twitter bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had about 66 followers yesterday. As of writing this, I have 208 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremybernier&quot;&gt;@jeremybernier&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in I couldn’t have cared less about my number of Twitter followers. I don’t tweet that much and am not trying to sell or advertise anything. But after seeing how effective the bot was from the get go, it quickly got addicting. It was like being a kid again writing scripts to bot my Runescape account, except now this is real life. But now I’ve hit the daily follow limit (though I could still favorite tweets if I was particularly ambitious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a decent amount of personal accounts from entrepreneurs touting the effectiveness of Twitter marketing, and my short experiment has only reinforced this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically get 0 traffic to this site, maybe a couple hits if I’m lucky. Yesterday I got 23. Is that a lot? No. But this blog isn’t even directly linked in my profile. Even more interesting is the fact that I’ve gotten actual non-automated responses from people - in the form of direct messages and tweets. Pretty cool given that I’m just an average dude. I could see this being very useful for networking and even job hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how I built the bot - I used Node.js and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ttezel/twit&quot;&gt;twit&lt;/a&gt; library. It was extremely simple to make because Twitter’s API let’s you do practically everything and is well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strategy revolved around targeting tweets with certain keywords and auto-following and/or favoriting them based on some simple logic used to eliminate users unlikely to follow me back. For example, I wouldn’t follow anyone who’s following/followers ratio was too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wrote scripts to automatically unfollow people who aren’t following me back (either because it’s been too long, or because they’re actively tweeting and thus obviously not going to follow back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday (end of day):&lt;/strong&gt; 208 followers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt; 304&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt; 441&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; 571&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt; 809&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday at 11:24am:&lt;/strong&gt; 854, &lt;strong&gt;Friday end of day:&lt;/strong&gt; 1,035&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday:&lt;/strong&gt; 1,232&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got suspended from writing to the Twitter API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some jQuery scripts that don’t involve the API. You can run them in the developer console in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfavorite tweets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$(&amp;#39;.ProfileTweet-actionButtonUndo.u-linkClean.js-actionButton.js-actionFavorite.js-tooltip&amp;#39;).click();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove users you’re following who aren’t following you back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var list = $(&amp;#39;.ProfileCard-content&amp;#39;);
for (var i=0; i &amp;lt; list.length; i++) {
  if ($(list[i]).find(&amp;#39;.FollowStatus&amp;#39;).length &amp;lt;= 0) {
    $(list[i]).find(&amp;#39;.user-actions-follow-button.js-follow-btn.follow-button.btn.small.small-follow-btn&amp;#39;).click();
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Remote Work is the Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dilbert ComicRemote work is becoming more and more mainstream as companies are realizing that chaining their employees to a desk in front of…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/remote-work/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/remote-work/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/dilbert.20882.strip-00b91f5384bf4b90406fabdaba3f02a1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dilbert Comic&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote work is becoming more and more mainstream as companies are realizing that chaining their employees to a desk in front of a laptop for 8+ hours/day in fields that are intellectual in nature, as opposed to value being time-oriented (eg. manufacturing and menial minimum wage jobs), may not be the most productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like GitHub, Automattic (makers of WordPress), Mozilla, 37Signals, Canonical, and Buffer are already proving that 100% remote teams can be just as effective, if not more so, than traditional workplaces. Remote job boards are springing up as startups attempt to gain a foothold on the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the rising prevalence of remote work, most employees still look at remote work with disdain, something relegated to outsourcing cheap Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are most definitely benefits to having your employees in the same room. Communication and overseeing your employees is easier. But there are benefits to remote work that are often overlooked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of remote work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheaper due to not having to purchase office space, a desk, chair, free food, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wider talent pool to hire from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time wasted on a commute (or at least less time if you go to coffee shops)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average work commute in the U.S. is 25 minutes, which means 50 minutes is wasted everyday. For someone worth $50/hr, that’s $41.67/day, or $10,000/year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee has more freedom, and thus is happier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More freedom with time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom of geographical location (can nomad around Europe if he/she is inclined)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most kids grow up only seeing their dads/moms at night and on the weekends. I’m not a father, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6795305&quot;&gt;based on what I hear from parents&lt;/a&gt;, I can only imagine how much happier I’d be having the opportunity to watch them grow up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized that I’m most productive when I move to a different location every couple hours or so (and I’ve read other similar accounts). I’ll be at a coffee shop, and then walk to another coffee shop. In the 5-10 minute walk, I’ll typically gain some bigger picture insight that I didn’t see before. At the new location, the differing environment keeps things fresh and exciting. On a more macro level, working at the same desk in the same office for months and years can get stale and uninspiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate although closely related to the issue of working remotely is the concept of time = value. A 9-5 job is not identical, but very close to trading time for money, like being paid by the hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously time is not the same as value, especially in intellectually demanding fields. When you’re being paid by the hour, your incentive isn’t to work as efficiently as possible, but to take just long enough to where you can get as much money as you want while still performing adequately enough to reach your goals (whether that’s to get a promotion or not get fired). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional mandated 9-5, there’s no incentive to bust your ass off and finish the day’s work by noon because you’ll still be stuck there until 5pm. Your reward for working harder is just more work. Showing up and staring at your laptop is equated to working. Whereas if you were to work remotely, you’re judged entirely by the value you produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to hiring remotely is that it involves a greater level of trust. Who’s to say your remote employer isn’t slacking off all day and doing the bare minimum? That’s why someone who hires remotely needs some way to track the employee’s output aside from just seeing that he’s in the office and looks busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I believe that remote jobs will continue to become more and more commonplace until they become the norm. Right now companies entice prospective applicants with perks like ping-pong tables and free food, but in 5 years that perk will be the ability to take their laptop wherever they want. The workplace is evolving due to the increasing intellectual nature of jobs. On a separate note, automation is eliminating away most of our work, but that’s a post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflections after getting a Master’s in Operations Research from Columbia University]]></title><description><![CDATA[I just finished the Master’s program in operations research from the School of Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University…]]></description><link>https://www.jeremyabroad.com/columbia-university-masters-reflections/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jeremyabroad.com/columbia-university-masters-reflections/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I just finished the Master’s program in operations research from the School of Engineering &amp;#x26; Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University. I probably never should have been accepted because I don’t care about operations research, but education is a business and they figured it was worth the (government) money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference: I did my undergrad in math at a state school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Impression: All my classmates were international, mostly from China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone in my department (Industrial Engineering &amp;#x26; Operations Research) was from China. This is true not only of IEOR, but of graduate engineering in general. After China, the most common countries were France, India, and Greece. There is a definite language barrier and the ethnicities often tended to stick to themselves and speak their own language, though they were always friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t exaggerate when I say that I could probably count the number of Americans in my class on two hands (one hand for white or black people) out of a class of 100-200 students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don’t mean to imply that this is a good or bad thing - I enjoy meeting people from other countries because they have different perspectives and it’s interesting learning about their cultures. I only bring this up because I don’t think most Americans are aware how few Americans there are in graduate school engineering)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone wants to work in finance or consulting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly due to selection bias, but as quoted from a classmate who also did her undergrad there, “Columbia brainwashes you into working in finance or consulting” (she got her chemical engineering degree and is now an investment banker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a huge shame that our brightest minds are lured into working in such socially useless industries rather than doing more meaningful work. But that’s the topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting, particularly in finance, is great. But most companies only want undergrads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s incredible how ridiculously structured corporate recruiting is. Having a Master’s usually counts against you for the “prestigious” jobs. Although there are lots of great jobs on Columbia’s campus recruiting platform, filtering out jobs that don’t allow applications from grad students eliminates about 80% of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations research classes aren’t a walk in the park. Especially true for “Stochastic Models”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most OR students are financial engineering rejects (myself included) and don’t care about OR. Even the ones who applied to OR generally don’t care about OR. I’ve noticed that graduate students in math tend to be disengaged from their work because the work often has little relevance to reality. Even the classes that appear relevant aren’t, serving as little more than theoretical masturbation (eg. game theory).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most engineering PhD students want out and advise against making the same “mistake” they did (admittedly this is from a small sample size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s students are the cash cow of the university. I was told by a PhD student on the engineering council that when the school faces budget constraints, one of the first things they do is expand Master’s programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations Research and “Management Science &amp;#x26; Engineering” are the same degrees. Just that in the latter, you’re more restricted in your coursework, forced to take “Operations Consulting”, and have a slightly higher probably of getting into business school courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being able to take 4 classes in whatever area/school you want is awesome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 10 classes you have to take, 4 can be in whatever school you want (another engineering department, business school, School of International and Public Relations, etc). I sampled some SIPA courses and spent my electives in the business school. Which leads me to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d rather be a business school student&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business school students have it so much better than engineering masters students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all: the amount of work required is relatively a joke. In engineering, you have weekly problem sets that probably take a minimum of five hours to complete per class. In the B-school, you might have an assignment every 2–3 weeks and it’ll take maybe an hour if you’re unlucky. The work is a hell of a lot easier, and in my opinion, a hell of a lot more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, your grades in B-school don’t matter! There’s a non-disclosure policy, which means that potential employers don’t get to see your grades. So students don’t really need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember once studying in Butler (the business school library) and then having my table get taken over by B-school students. They spent the whole time talking about their elaborate international vacation plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of brilliant professors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was what I found most valuable of the B-school courses. A lot of the professors are just total ballers in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m going to discuss some more general impressions I got of Columbia University overall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone (except the B-school) is overworked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of Asians (I’m allowed to say this because I’m Asian)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of pressure to take the typical elite school path of going into high finance, with consulting a close second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gym is subpar and the football team always loses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The girls around campus are actually pretty attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morningside Heights is its own little bubble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morningside Heights doesn’t even feel like New York. Some people like it, I hated it. I never really felt like I lived in New York City living in Morningside Heights. As a fellow classmate from India summed it up: “I watch videos of NYC in my apartment wishing I lived there.” The grass really is greener downtown, and going down there is a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I never felt in danger at Columbia, it’s definitely not the safest area. You hear stories of people occasionally getting harassed and robbed. I never personally experienced it and it’s definitely rare, but it does happen. There are a lot of bums up there. Once one of them yelled a racial slur at my Asian American friend as we were walking. That infuriated me, but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways I’d had enough of Morningside Heights and eventually moved downtown to East Village, where I spent my last semester. The commute was definitely annoying - being 45 minutes and two transfers - but to me it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall my experience was good. I got what I wanted out of it, which was mainly the name, living in NYC, and more time to figure out what to do with my life. In a couple months I’m going to pay for it in the form of debt. That’s going to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish I had been interested in entrepreneurship sooner. The resources at Columbia for that sort of thing are tremendous. At one point my friend told me about Steve Blank’s Lean Launchpad class. At the time I didn’t care. Now I’ve realized I’ve missed out on a great opportunity. But that’s life. I’ll have to carve my own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In another post I’ll talk about the actual stuff I learned, and why most of it was a waste of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
