This eliminates the whole “where is this money coming from” objection, and is equivalent to the government just distribution tax money as a dividend and allowing individuals to decide how they want to spend it.</li>\n<li>Instead of $1,000 in cash, $1,000 in a special bank account that can only be spent on approved domestic goods/services (eg. paying for transportation, housing, essential food, small businesses, donating to science, not cigarettes). I’m not a fan of this paternalistic approach (though there’s a legitimate case to be made to restrict the money to domestic goods to stimulate domestic businesses/jobs and preserve the currency), but if this were more politically feasible it’d be a step in the right direction.</li>\n<li>UBI only receivable as funding for approved projects or needs. UBI in this sense serves kind of like Venture Capital funding for startups, or tenured professorship for intellectuals (I expand on this idea later).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also to make a UBI more politically feasible, we could make it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt-in</li>\n<li>$1,000/month, and not increase with inflation (to appease people afraid of inflation spiraling out of control). </li>\n<li>Only receivable by people who haven’t been convicted of a serious violent crime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the biggest objections people give are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wouldn’t people stop working?</li>\n<li>Why should lazy people be entitled to this money?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disability insurance scamming aside, here’s how I’d address this.</p>\n<h3>Require any recipient of the UBI to write in a public database what they intend to “work on”.</h3>\n<p>This could be followed up by monthly or biweekly status updates.</p>\n<p>This database would be publicly searchable. So if I’m receiving a Universal Basic Income, then you could search my name and see exactly what I said I’d be working on.</p>\n<p>We could be strict regarding what gets approval for a UBI, or we could be lenient and allow everyone to get it (so long as they aren’t flat out lying or being evil). I prefer the latter because I’m not a fan of having some committee determine how other people want to spend their time.</p>\n<p>One might ask - <strong>what is to stop people from claiming to work on something, but not actually getting anything done?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s why we make the database public. If somebody isn’t delivering, then they can be publicly shamed, or even worse lose their UBI.</p>\n<p>Now the obvious concern here is security. There might be that one extreme anti-UBI psycho crusader who decides to punish anyone on a UBI, or anybody using that UBI money in ways that the criminal doesn’t like. </p>\n<p>But ultimately I see two main value adds here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Having to publicly declare and commit to working on a project would likely make people more likely to use their UBI to work on something useful (instead of just blowing it on say gambling). The public aspect brings social pressure to actually delivering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being able to see what every other recipient is working on brings transparency, so people can see where the UBI money is going towards (at least what people claim it’s going towards). If most people are obviously not using their money efficiently and we’re seeing societal problems (eg. massive inflation), then we can be stricter on who receives the UBI.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end result is that this would 1. enourage more productive behavior 2. give people an idea of where this money is going. If we’re not satisfied with the level of productivity of the UBI recipients, then we can increase the strictness of what work is required of a UBI recipient.</p>\n<p>Again I prefer the more libertarian approach of just letting everyone who’s not a violent criminal receive a UBI no-strings-attached (assuming the country can afford it of course) because applying a value-judgement to work is inherently subjective. But any step towards UBI is a step towards alleviating poverty and greater individual freedom, or monumental steps in the right direction.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Would Implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI)","date":"July 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/ubi-implement/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/modern-monetary-theory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modern Monetary Theory Primer","tags":["politics"]}},"next":null}}}
