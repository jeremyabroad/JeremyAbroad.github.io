Government debt isn’t necessarily a bad thing. <strong>The only constraint to government spending is inflation.</strong></p>\n<p><em>(Note: MMT only applies to countries with (1) full control over their sovereign fiat currencies (2) floating exchange rates. So this does not apply to any EU country)</em></p>\n<p>This is a radical departure from mainstream economics because it violates the following mainstream beliefs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monetary policy (ie. the Central Bank) should primarily be responsible for managing inflation (whereas MMT says that fiscal policy should manage inflation)</li>\n<li>The money supply and interest rates are the primary drivers of inflation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarism\">Monetarism</a>)</li>\n<li>Deficit spending crowds out private spending, and high levels of government debt increase interest rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now there is no debate that a government can technically never default on debt denominated in its own currency (since it can print up as much of its own money as it needs). The debate is the extent to which this is inflationary.</p>\n<h3>Is Government debt inflationary?</h3>\n<p>The mainstream belief is that a high level of government debt relative to GDP is dangerous, and will lead to rising interest rates as investors demand a higher return for what they perceive as a higher risk. This makes government borrowing more expensive, which can compound and then spiral out of control.</p>\n<p>Critics often cite the hyperinflationary episodes of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Weimar Germany to warn of the dangers of excess money printing. But this is simplistic scaremongering that fails to understand the real root causes of these hyperinflationary episodes - severe supply shocks and large amounts of foreign denominated debts. If hyperinflation were as simple as “printing too much money”, then governments would just stop printing money and all would be well. (I’ll write more about hyperinflation in another post as it is impossible to do it justice in a single paragraph)</p>\n<p>Although this should be blaringly obvious - what governments spend their money on matters. If governments pay idle workers to dig and fill up holes, then this will not create any new wealth or economic value, and thus if anything should be inflationary. </p>\n<p>However, if the government pays workers to create a new factory that creates a valuable good that others demand, then the increased economic activity could mean we don’t see inflation. Taxes also wouldn’t necessarily have to increase due to the higher tax revenues resulting from the increasing economic activity.</p>\n<h3>Jobs Guarantee</h3>\n<p>The jobs guarantee is a chief proposal of many MMT advocates. Perhaps the most popular proposal is the guaranteeing of a job at $15/hr with the intention of serving as a “buffer stock” for the labor force. The idea is that employers prefer to hire people who’re already employed and have experience, so a jobs program would eliminate “being unemployed” and “lacking work experience” as reasons for employers to reject candidates.</p>\n<p>Like government spending, the effectiveness would of course depend on how effectively the government can put people to use. At best we could create useful jobs that provide value in ways that the private sector doesn’t do enough of (eg. more R&#x26;D jobs), at worst we end up with people wasting their time digging up and filling holes.</p>\n<h3>So what’s the big controversy over MMT?</h3>\n<p>Most MMT critics don’t actually seem to understand MMT. For example, MMT is often conflated with the idea that we can just print unlimited amounts of money with no consequences. As far as I’m aware, no major theory advocates this. MMT doesn’t even advocate money printing, rather it states that countries with sovereign currencies aren’t constrained by fiscal budgets.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable that many economists are giving such harsh knee-jerk reactions critical of MMT, because MMT flies completely in the face of the core beliefs of many of these mainstream neoclassical economics. It’s like finding out that the sky is red - your impulse is probably to be skeptical.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Modern Monetary Theory Primer","date":"July 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/modern-monetary-theory/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/economics-is-political/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Economics is Political","tags":["politics"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ubi-implement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Would Implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI)","tags":["politics"]}}}}}
