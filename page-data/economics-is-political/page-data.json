To put it simply, <strong>economics is the study of the economy.</strong> The economy includes production, distribution, labor, trade, consumption, debt, banking, government spending, taxes, currency, and anything involving a market.</p>\n<p>So according to economists, virtually every aspect of society and government policy can be considered subject to the economics discipline. One would certainly get that notion reading Freakonomics. Of course this is quite an arrogant claim.</p>\n<p>Many economists claim that it is their methodology and tools that distinguishes their field. But by this logic, what gives economists more credence to solving these societal problems vs. mathematicians and statisticians? After all, economists use math and statistics to justify their conclusions.</p>\n<p>As you can see, any discipline must be defined by its domain of study. Psychology is the study of individuals, sociology is the study of societies, and economics is the study of economies.</p>\n<h3>Political Economy</h3>\n<p>Economics was originally called “political economy”. But when economists wanted to become a science by introducing mathematical models, “economics” was branched off into its own discipline.</p>\n<p>But at its core, economics is the study of the economy, and the economy is inherently politically-defined. Any metric used to evaluate an economy is inherently political.</p>\n<h3>Normative vs. Positive</h3>\n<p>Economists distinguish between subjective (normative, or “what ought to be”) and objective (positive, or “what is”) economics.</p>\n<p>In theory economists could be strictly objective. For example, an economist could study how a tax increase would affect the economy, and present his/her results to politicians.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/f4bb7/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.17299471963793%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"vlad busuioc xyPxcqh8Tt8 unsplash\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/c739e/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/8ee9c/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 148w,\n/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/ebbe7/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 295w,\n/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/c739e/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 590w,\n/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/5413e/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 885w,\n/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/4efde/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 1180w,\n/static/d0c28f87d98a68b0a866b4717cb97715/f4bb7/vlad-busuioc-xyPxcqh8Tt8-unsplash.jpg 3977w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>But in reality:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There are inherent subjective value judgements to any policy decision. Deciding that GDP is the primary metric inherently places a subjective value judgement on the importance of GDP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assumes the existing structure, which is inherently politically defined and isn’t necessarily optimal. The boundaries of markets are always politically defined (eg. no child labor). The “black market” is probably the purest free market, but even that is politically defined in the sense that it’s illegal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In practice, these studies are often funded by corporations with an agenda and personal conflict of interest (eg. banks funding studies touting free movement of capital)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In practice, economists use models with flawed assumptions (eg. assuming perfect competition, equilibrium)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if we take into account these caveats, then sure we can make guesses as to what the empirical results of either policies would be. But it’s impossible to conclude that one is better than the other without imposing a value judgement. It’s not like a sports game where the team with the greatest number of points wins - there is no objective definition as to what even constitutes a point, and humanity is too complex to be reducable to any meaningful number.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, any economics study assumes an existing politically-defined structure that may or may not be optimal. By focusing the debate on “what would happen if we increase/decrease X”, we might lose sight of the fact that X might be irrelevant in the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>For example, an increase in the minimum wage might increase/decrease well-being, but perhaps eliminating the minimum wage altogether and implementing a universal basic income and/or jobs guarantee would be even better.</p>\n<h3>Different Schools of Economic Thought</h3>\n<p>Neoclassical economics despite all its enormous flaws is currently the dominant economic theory in universities. But this is just one school of economic thought with one set of assumptions.</p>\n<p>There are many other economics theories: Keynesian, Behavioral, Marxist, Developmentalist, Institutionalist, Classical, Neoclassical, Schumpetarian, Austrian, Monetarist, Modern Monetary Theory, etc.</p>\n<p>Choosing any one school of thought itself is a subjective choice.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/986f8/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"markus spiske 3Tf1J8q9bBA unsplash\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/c739e/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/8ee9c/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 148w,\n/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/ebbe7/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 295w,\n/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/c739e/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 590w,\n/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/5413e/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 885w,\n/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/4efde/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 1180w,\n/static/a42f9785cdb151e915dfe1fcc8c0bbe5/986f8/markus-spiske-3Tf1J8q9bBA-unsplash.jpg 3072w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Central Banks are Political</h3>\n<p>Centrals banks manage a country’s money supply.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the U.S. They have two mandates: to achieve stable prices and full employment.</p>\n<p>These mandates themselves are inherently political. The Fed generally targets a 2% inflation rate, despite their being no scientific justification for why prices should increase 2% every year.</p>\n<p>The decision of which metric to prioritize is political. Should full employment really be a chief metric if the quality of jobs are low (eg. low pay, long hours, not meaningful), or if the technology exists such that people could be free to spend their time in leisure or however they want?</p>\n<p>The Fed manages the money supply via open market operations such as QE and modifying interest rates on excess reserves and repurchase agreements.</p>\n<p>These “tools” are inherently political. For example, instead of buying/selling treasures from bulge bracket banks, they could implement “helicopter money” and credit the bank accounts of every American.</p>\n<p>But wait, how important is the Fed anyways? The Monetarist school lead by Milton Friedman believes that the economy’s performance is determined almost entirely by changes in the money supply, and thus that the Central Bank is paramount to managing the economy.</p>\n<p>Modern Monetary Theorists on the other hand would argue that fiscal policy should be the main manager of the economy, not the Central Bank. After all, only through fiscal policy can we truly guarantee full employment via a jobs guarantee. No amount of interest rate tweaking can guarantee full employment. And inflation isn’t just a single simple metric in any meaningful sense, it is compromised of any good/service with a market price and its corresponding power structures that influence their prices.</p>\n<p>Central Banks cannot control spiraling university tuition or healthcare costs, or spiking agriculture prices due to environmental disasters, or housing price inflation due to housing policies that restrict the supply of affordable housing and access to tenants most in need.</p>\n<h3>Macroeconomics is not a science</h3>\n<p>A science requires a certain degree of precision and objectivity that macroeconomics lacks. There are just too many damn variables for any sense of precision. The choice to look at any variables is inherently political.</p>\n<p>Regression and math/statistics can be used to find correlations, but since this is the study of human behavior, deducing anything deeper such as causality requires qualitiative analysis. Anything descriptive can theoretically be objective, but anything prescriptive (eg. policy recommendations) will inherently be political.</p>\n<p>So at best economists can point out correlations or guess as to what caused something</p>\n<h3>Arrogance of Economists</h3>\n<p>Despite the political nature of the “dismal science”, economics still somehow enjoys its privilege status at the forefront of politics. Economists are given a disproportionate amount of credibility when it comes to political matters. Things that neoclassical economists say like “government budget deficits are a big deal” are taken as gospel. The Federal Reserve, a bunch of economists tweaking interest rates, are treated like the chief arbiters of the economy. The White House has a “Council of Economic Advisors”.</p>\n<p>More people need to recognize economics for what it is - people using equations to rationalize their political beliefs, often funded by corporations and rich people with a conflict of interest in preserving/expanding power to those with money (read: markets).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ha-joon-chang-economics_n_5120030\">Ha-Joon Chang: Economics Is A Political Argument</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why Economics is Political","date":"July 22, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/economics-is-political/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/economics-importance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Economics is the Most Important Field Affecting Our Lives","tags":["politics"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/modern-monetary-theory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modern Monetary Theory Primer","tags":["politics"]}}}}}
