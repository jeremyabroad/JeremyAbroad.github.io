(eg. budgeting, performance review)</li>\n<li>Non-managerial workers spend 16% of their time on internal compliance. This translates to an <strong>annual waste of 8.9 million worker years, or 8.9 million workers</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In total then, <strong>there are 21.4 million workers (12.5m + 8.9m) creating little to no economic value</strong> in the U.S. In other words, <strong>current economic output could be maintained with 15% fewer people in the labor force.</strong></p>\n<h3>Some interesting case studies:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Svenska Handelsbanken</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its return on equity has surpassed that of its European peers every year since 1971.</li>\n<li>Consistently posted industry-beating cost-to-income and loan-loss ratios.</li>\n<li>In the organization of 12,000 associates, there are only three levels.</li>\n<li>Operating decisions are almost entirely decentralized (counter to conventional banking wisdom).</li>\n<li>Each branch makes its own loan decisions, sets its own pricing on loans and deposits, controls its own marketing budget, runs its own website (on a shared platform), and serves all customer segments — from individuals to multinationals — within its catchment area.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GE’s Durham plant</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more than 300 technicians and a single supervisor: the plant manager.</li>\n<li>more than twice as productive as its sister plants in GE Aviation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The manager/employee ratio in these and other vanguard organizations is more than double the U.S. average.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Excess Management Is Costing the U.S. $3 Trillion Per Year","date":"November 11, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/excess-management-costing-3-trillion/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dev-environment-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to set up a basic dev environment for web development (mac OSX / Linux)","tags":["tech"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/webpack-2-and-tree-shaking-results/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Upgrading to Webpack 2, and Tree-Shaking Results","tags":["tech"]}}}}}
