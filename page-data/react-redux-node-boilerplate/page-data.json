There’s still work to be done (eg. cleaning up code), but it works and the main boilerplate is implemented. </p>\n<p>GitHub link: <a href=\"https://github.com/JeremyBernier/react-redux-node-boilerplate\">https://github.com/JeremyBernier/react-redux-node-boilerplate</a></p>\n<p>Hopefully this will minimize the amount of time you have to waste writing boring boilerplate code just to get up and running. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Made a React Redux Node Boilerplate","date":"April 13, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/react-redux-node-boilerplate/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-work-efficiently/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to work efficiently and stop wasting your time","tags":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/flexbox/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shortest Flexbox Tutorial","tags":["tech"]}}}}}
