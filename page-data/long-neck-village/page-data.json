I checked my phone and saw that I had no service.</p>\n<p>Pay Yu, the man who drove my boat, was very friendly and told me a lot about life in the village. He told me that the women were allowed to choose whether or not to wear the rings, that there was no electricity in the village aside from the solar panels, and that many of the men didn’t have Thai citizenship (being Burmese refugees) and thus struggled to find work. The school in the village had recently been transformed to teach Thai. He was married but his wife didn’t wear the rings.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/af534/forest-bridge.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"forest bridge\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/b9e4f/forest-bridge.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/cf440/forest-bridge.png 148w,\n/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/d2d38/forest-bridge.png 295w,\n/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/b9e4f/forest-bridge.png 590w,\n/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/f9b6a/forest-bridge.png 885w,\n/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/2d849/forest-bridge.png 1180w,\n/static/10a5240a7484123a8f2b80b63d9c112e/af534/forest-bridge.png 3840w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>He asked me what state I was from and I said “Virginia”, and then he said “that’s one of the original colonies right?” (impressive, many foreigners from wealthier countries aren’t familiar with Virginia) From the age of 17, he’d spent 4 years going to school in the Karen refugee camp (high school and a little bit of university I believe) and then had volunteered there for another two years.

She said that all the religions got along with each other in harmony.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/21d4e/20181204_161150.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"nature\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/c739e/20181204_161150.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/8ee9c/20181204_161150.jpg 148w,\n/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/ebbe7/20181204_161150.jpg 295w,\n/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/c739e/20181204_161150.jpg 590w,\n/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/5413e/20181204_161150.jpg 885w,\n/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/4efde/20181204_161150.jpg 1180w,\n/static/c3afab8fc65ec83354e6cc63e1339cef/21d4e/20181204_161150.jpg 5312w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Takeaways</h3>\n<p>Overall I found it to be a very interesting experience.</p>\n<p>I was very impressed at their fluency in English. Their English was better than the average person in any South American or Ukrainian city, which is remarkable given that they’re living in a village with no internet or cell phone coverage.</p>\n<p>I sympathize with those who can’t get Thai citizenship and thus can’t legally work in Thailand. I think the government should do more to help these people. That being said, it would be unfair to single out the Thai government here because many countries nowadays (including the U.S.) are guilty of failing to integrate refugees.</p>\n<p>The people seemed remarkably content with their situation other than those without Thai citizenship who couldn’t legally work. I was expecting more of a desire to move to the city, but that was not the sense I got, though to be fair the people I spoke to constitute a very small sample size. Living in the city is expensive, and life seemed easier there.</p>\n<p>Despite not having internet or cell phone coverage, they definitely seem to have been exposed to the computer and the internet, so they’re not totally isolated from the outside world. I was surprised that the one woman had a Facebook accout.</p>\n<h3>Is Technological Advancement Good?</h3>\n<p>I find villages fascinating because life there is so different from what I’m used to having lived in the Washington D.C. area and NYC.</p>\n<p>A part of me wants to help out these villages by helping to connect them to the internet and supply them with phones and laptops, but another part of me questions whether this is actually a good thing.</p>\n<p>Is the average American or Japanese salaryman happier than the average villager here in Thailand or in Cuba? Is social media good, or does it make us feel inadequate and FOMO by exposing us to “dream” lifestyles we can never obtain?</p>\n<p>Regardless of your stance on technology, I think there’s a clear case to be made that work in the modern era is extroardinarily alienating for many people when their time is completely devoted to soulless jobs devoid of meaning or fulfillment, much of the money going to rent and/or mortgage often with little left over. This sentiment was summed up beautifully in the (excellent) documentary <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/lostboysofsudan/video-lostboysofsudan/\">Lost Boys of Sudan</a> when a Sudanese person says “in Africa we have time but no money, but in the U.S. there is money but no time”</p>\n<p>I would like to explore more villages and perhaps volunteer in one to learn more about the lives of villagers and their needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you do decide to visit the village, I highly recommend actually talking to the locals and learning about their culture and way of life. This was by far the most rewarding thing I did here, and had I not done this I would’ve only gotten a fraction of the experience. I didn’t actually see any other tourists doing this, most of them just walking around and taking pictures. I know it might feel weird, as though you’re intruding, but it’s not, and if anything that’s what you’re paying the 200 baht entrance fee for. I tipped every person I spoke to (some of whom tried to refuse the tip) but of course that is up to your discretion.</p>\n<h3>Controversy</h3>\n<p>Finally I will address the controversy, the accusations that this is a “human zoo”, that visiting this is unethical, that they’re held against their will, etc.</p>\n<p>None of the people I spoke to said they were being held against their will. All told me they could leave if they wanted to, and one lady even told me that she planned to move to the city in a couple years. Most of the husbands work in the city.</p>\n<p>It is true that many do not have Thai citizenship and thus cannot legally work. This is a problem and should be resolved. That being said, this is unfortunately not really different from how most countries handle refugees (including the U.S.).</p>\n<p>Since I went directly to the village without going through a tour or middleman, all the money I spent goes directly to the people. </p>\n<p>Now is it possible that I was lied to and that they’re secretly held hostage there? Sure. But after speaking to four people, two of them for at least 15-20 minutes, getting their emails and contact information, I did not get that impression. The man I spoke to worked in the city and was simply on holiday for the week.</p>\n<p>If indeed they are being exploited and held hostage, then that is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. But it is not the impression I got after speaking to these people. The burden of proof regarding any allegations of exploitation is on the accuser, and I see a lot of people throwing around accusations without any evidence.</p>\n<p>I get it, a lot of people are uncomfortable with what some call “poverty tourism”. When I was in South America it seemed that at least half of the tourists were uncomfortable with favela tours (though half of them would do it anyways and then afterwards claim they were still uncomfortable with it). I always thought this thinking was stupid, as if touring through Beverley Hills or the Upper East Side and padding the pockets of billionaires is more ethical and morally acceptible than visiting a slum and supporting their economy. By this logic, isn’t the whole concept of visiting a “poor” country unethical? Guess I should cancel that trip to India and Madagascar and book another trip to London and Paris /s. What utter nonsense.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I gave money to the village, learned about their culture, and have now raised awareness of their village and culture via writing this post. There’s a legitimate possibility I may go back and volunteer in the village or the refugee camp because I find it so interesting and think it would be rewarding.</p>\n<p>If anything I did was “unethical”, then please educate me on how so. But please back up any allegations with evidence, along with your reasoning as to how me visiting this village made these people any worse off.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Long Neck Village Impressions","date":"December 04, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/long-neck-village/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/objectives-freedom-technology/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Objectives Society Should Strive For - Freedom and Technological Advancement","tags":["politics"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/andrew-yang/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Andrew Yang","tags":["politics"]}}}}}
