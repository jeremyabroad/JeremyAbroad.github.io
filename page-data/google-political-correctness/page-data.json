Having a contrarian view on these topics is offensive, makes you a sexist/racist, and is grounds for social ostracization and getting fired from your job</li>\n<li>The media will turn anything it can into a scandal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some of those politically correct assertions that take on almost religious-like qualities in the sense that the mere questioning of them is blasphemy and will get you socially lambasted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There are no biological differences between men and women that may influence their predisposition towards certain kinds of work (eg. <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/14/summers-comments-on-women-and-science/\">Larry Summers is apparently sexist for even suggesting the possibility</a>). Any statement that perpetuates female stereotypes is sexist, even an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/12/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-ignites-social-media-firestorm/\">innocuous joke</a> (or even a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/\">misconstrued joke in someone else’s private conversation</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s sexist to suggest that men tend to be better than women at certain things, but <a href=\"https://abc7.com/4377601/\">it’s not sexist when you reverse the genders</a> (note that this directly contradicts the previous bullet point). </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/\">Women are underpaid compared to men for the same work</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Men, especially white men, are always more privileged and do not face discrimination</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Discrimination against men, whites, and Asians is justified if its done to promote underrepresented minorities (affirmative action)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rape is about power and has nothing to do with sex <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/105393-prostitution-decriminalized-rhode-islands-experiment\">[1]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prostitution is sexist against women</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legalizing prostitution increases human trafficking <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/105393-prostitution-decriminalized-rhode-islands-experiment\">[1]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a female accuses a man of rape, the man is guilty until proven innocent (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress_Performance_%28Carry_That_Weight%29\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus\">[3]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case\">[4]</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/magazine/the-lessons-of-stanfords-sex-assault-case-reversal.html\">[5]</a> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?id=4300383\">[6]</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Men’s rights activists are sexist</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Capitalism is the best economic system</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disputing any of these gender-related views is offensive, and it’s your responsibility that I’m offended and emotionally uncomfortable over being presented an alternative viewpoint. I must be coddled from opposing viewpoints, such as via trigger warnings and safe spaces.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice the double standard here. It’s only considered sexist or racist when it makes underrepresented minorities look bad, and depending on the context. For example: saying that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476221\">women are more empathetic than men</a> generally isn’t considered sexist, but it becomes sexist when it’s used to suggest that it may have something to do with why women are less likely to pursue computer programming as a profession. Women being underrepresented in tech is an urgent national problem caused only by discrimination, but men being underrepresented in psychology, education, and nursing isn’t a problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Political Correctness: Anti-intellectual dogmatism and hostility against select non-mainstream viewpoints</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PC culture can also be leveraged to one’s advantage outside of the topics at hand. <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/285-17/mayor-de-blasio-signs-bill-prohibiting-all-nyc-employers-inquiring-salary-history-job#/0\">NYC recently passed a bill</a> prohibiting employers from inquiring about salary history of job applicants. The bill benefits all job applicants unanimously and has nothing to do with gender/race (just like raising the minimum wage is not an “African American” bill), yet the heading in their own press release reads “City takes major step toward achieving pay equity for women and people of color”, leading one to wonder if the same bill would have been passed had it not been framed in terms of the “gender gap”.</p>\n<p>PC culture suppresses non-PC viewpoints via ad hominem attacks such as via name-calling (eg. sexist, racist), which is intellectually hostile, juvenile, and anti-diversity (similar to the Church in the old days shaming and executing scientists for having viewpoints that didn’t align with the church’s agenda). The viewpoint not aligning with one’s agenda does not excuse this behavior. The claim that intellectual censoring is justified because certain people are too sensitive to handle the opposing viewpoint and thus must be coddled is also nonsensical, especially considering that the reverse is almost always permissible (the double standard).</p>\n<h3>The Role of the Media</h3>\n<p>The American public needs to realize that the media is facilitating these “scandals”, perpetuating this culture of political correctness and knee-jerk public lynching.</p>\n<p>The media, which profits almost exclusively off ad revenue from views, is incentivized to turn anything it can into a scandal because it translates to more attention and money (employing tactics such as “clickbait” and sensationalism).</p>\n<p>The first article to reveal this memo was written by Gizmodo and titled: <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320\">“Exclusive: Here’s The Full 10-Page Anti-Diversity Screed Circulating Internally at Google”</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/the-most-common-error-in-coverage-of-the-google-memo/536181/?single_page=true\">similar damning headlines were used in numerous other mainstream media outlets.</a> CNN’s snapchat coverage on the story was titled “Sexist Manifesto Puts Google in Hot Seat”.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 396px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/gatsby-starter-blog/static/03539bb0fe80d815a83597690eca5395/e3813/cnn-snapchat-story.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150.5050505050505%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"CNN Snapchat story coverage of Google memo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/gatsby-starter-blog/static/03539bb0fe80d815a83597690eca5395/e3813/cnn-snapchat-story.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/gatsby-starter-blog/static/03539bb0fe80d815a83597690eca5395/8ee9c/cnn-snapchat-story.jpg 148w,\n/gatsby-starter-blog/static/03539bb0fe80d815a83597690eca5395/ebbe7/cnn-snapchat-story.jpg 295w,\n/gatsby-starter-blog/static/03539bb0fe80d815a83597690eca5395/e3813/cnn-snapchat-story.jpg 396w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Anybody who actually read the memo will see that it is not “anti-diversity” or “sexist”. The memo literally opens with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don’t endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can’t have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Due to the media’s overarching influence over public perception, their reporting becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating scandals out of thin air and skewing public perception to serve their interests (<a href=\"http://www.morriscreative.com/wp2011/assets/2012/06/info.jpg\">6 corporations own 90% of the media</a>).</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p><strong>We have a hostile culture of dogmatism and anti-intellectualism (ie. political correctness)</strong> around certain topics, and it’s disgraceful. <strong>Constructive criticism and contrarian arguments should be encouraged rather than silenced, critiqued on the merit of their arguments rather than being the brunt of personal attacks accusing the author of sexism/racism.</strong></p>\n<p>The media also needs to be held accountable for perpetuating this anti-intellectual PC culture via their clickbait headlines and disingenuous sensationalism. This applies not only to the media, but also online communities such as Reddit where the default subreddits blatantly censor dissenting viewpoints and promote echo-chamber hivemind mentality.</p>\n<p>We cannot begin to come to a solution without first identifying the problem. <strong>Political correctness is a problem</strong>, and needs to be treated as such. The gross perversion of political correctness is a huge reason why Donald Trump, perhaps the least politically correct U.S. presidential candidate in history, won the presidential election.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’ve heard of some college campuses where they don’t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative, or they don’t want to read a book if it had language that is offensive to African Americans or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I’ve got to tell you, I don’t agree with that either — that you when you become students at colleges, you have to be coddled and protected from different points of view. Anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with them, but you shouldn’t silence them by saying you can’t come because I’m too sensitive to hear what you have to say.” -Barack Obama</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>McCarthyism is still alive, it’s just taken a different form.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeremybernier/googles-testament-to-political-correctness-eb7d9ac974b5\">This article on Medium.com</a></em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google’s Testament to Political Correctness","date":"August 09, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/google-political-correctness/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/south-korea-dystopian-nightmare/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"South Korea's Dystopian Nightmare","tags":["travel","politics"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/walkable-cities-japan-korea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How Japan and Korea Design Cities for People instead of Cars [Video]","tags":["travel","politics"]}}}}}
