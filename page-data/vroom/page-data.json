I was honored to be given the task to rebuild their website from the ground up - any web engineer’s dream.</p>\n<h4>The Problem - Old Website</h4>\n<p>The existing website was powered by .NET and Azure on the backend, and had a bit of React on the frontend, but without any framework.</p>\n<p>There were a host of problems on the old website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Extremely slow. Any page on the site would take anywhere from 500ms-3s to load, and in the ecommerce world this literally translates to lost revenue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Development time was slow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixing new bugs and developing new features was time consuming.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Server costs were relatively high.</p>\n<h3>My Proposal - New Website</h3>\n<p>I decided to build a Universal Javascript Single-Page App with Node.js, React, and Redux.</p>\n<p>server-side rendering</p>\n<p>To do this we had two options, build our own </p>\n<p>Next.js?</p>\n<p>CSS</p>\n<p>A/B testing</p>\n<p>caching cars</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Site Performance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Development Time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduced server costs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I remember the CEO approaching me to congratulate me on the website, saying it was blazing fast.</p>\n<p>Code reviews</p>\n<h3>Management</h3>\n<p>We adopted agile/scrum for the sake of scoping out the work and giving a sense of structure. I did weekly 1-on-1 meetings with each member of my team to ensure no one was blocked and any concerns would be voiced.</p>\n<p>I’m a strong believer in empowering individuals, and am very much against micromanagement as I believe it is unproductive and reduces morale. If somebody is delivering or not delivering, it’s fairly obvious to tell.</p>\n<p>If a team member isn’t pulling his or her weight, I’ll tell them - and it’s never a surprise. If they don’t turn things around after that, when that doesn’t leave many options.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>The </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m so grateful to have been given this opportunity. Specifically, I have to thank John Rodkey for believing in me. And of course I have to thank the team who brought this to life, and continue to carry it on after I’ve left (you know who you are).</p>\n<p>The new site is blazing fast and light years ahead of the old one. Developing on the site is so easy it’s “boring” (in a good way :P). To be honest, I’d never seen an ecommerce site as a single-page app, but I’m convinced the entire web will eventually move to single-page apps as the technology gets more accessible. You just can’t beat the page speed performance of not having to refresh.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Vroom.com as Universal SPA with React","date":"August 14, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/vroom/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/iheart/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iHeart.com","tags":["tech"]}},"next":null}}}
