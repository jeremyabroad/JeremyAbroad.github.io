No other field affects your day to day life more than economics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is responsible for what you do for a living. If there were more science jobs and they were more competitive with finance jobs, then perhaps more potentially brilliant scientists and engineers would go into fields like cancer research rather than investment banking</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why people can’t find jobs. If we had a jobs guarantee, then unemployment wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why enormous technological advancement has not reduced work hours (despite Keynes predicting his grandchildren today would work 15 hour weeks), and the average American has less vacation time than a Medieval peasant</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why people can’t afford homes and/or struggle to pay their rent, despite the fact that there are 6 empty homes for every homeless person. In NYC there are 70,000 homeless people despite 250,000 vacant rental apartments. Meanwhile, there are wealthy landlords who profit off of this land ownership and make millions of dollars in passive income in land rents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why there are poor people - why poverty exists and people live in financial insecurity. Poverty (within wealthy countries) could be solved tomorrow if we enacted something like a Universal Basic Income and universal healthcare, we just chose not to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why many desperate people who can’t find a job go into crime, sellings drugs, and even selling their bodies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why the environment gets wrecked, cities get polluted, water polluted, ecosystems destroyed, and we experience “climate change”, yet do litte to nothing about it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why medical bills are the #1 cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. It’s why people ignore going to the hospital and die preventable deaths. It’s why people with mental health issues don’t get the help they need, until they either hurt someone else or themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why we educate foreigners and sell them university degrees, and then kick them when they try to work here and contribute to our economy with our visa lottery system and its indentured servitude like binding to one’s employer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why over half of all Americans dislike their jobs. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics is why people still commute long hours to an office 5 days/week in a city they’re tired of despite the fact that the internet and remote working tools makes remote work feasible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you might be thinking, <strong>“wait…isn’t this all politics?”</strong></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/ffbed/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61.050000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"econ\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/c739e/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/8ee9c/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 148w,\n/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/ebbe7/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 295w,\n/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/c739e/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 590w,\n/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/5413e/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 885w,\n/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/4efde/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 1180w,\n/static/03469c436876e4c9ee49e5ae1966a0d2/ffbed/alex-radelich-Evo4wmtRaPI-unsplash.jpg 6000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Yes, it is politics.

Economics cannot answer this question - it can only speak to the tradeoffs of various kinds of healthcare systems.</p>\n<p>Economics in theory could be an objective science, but in practice is used to impose a specific political agenda, specifically the neoliberal one.</p>\n<p>Not only does mainstream economics try to rationalize a specific set of political policies (the neoliberal agenda), but it restricts the debate to effectively the tweaking of variables within the current framework. </p>\n<p>For example, monetarists have convinced us that the Federal Reserve is the primary agent responsible for managing the economy’s health. But why is this the case? Should they really be the prime agents in control of our economy? But how effective is the Federal Reserve anyways? Why does the Fed tweak the interest rates of big banks instead of going directly to the people? Why do we “print money” to subsidize the banks and the wealthy instead of giving it to the people (eg. helicopter money).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum…” -Noam Chomsky</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The debate on taxation is often simplistically framed as lower taxes vs. higher taxes. Why not change the way we tax, focusing more on taxing externalities, unearned income, and capital vs. labor?</p>\n<p>Economics has convinced us that the most important metric is GDP growth, but does GDP really matter?</p>\n<p>If we really cared so much about obtaining full employment, then we’d institute a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee\">jobs guarantee</a>. But since we haven’t done that despite the fact that we could certainly afford it, it would seem that the economists don’t really care about full employment as much as they pay lip service to it.</p>\n<p>Free market fundamentalism has overtaken the economics profession because markets give power to those who have money. It’s the smartest way to give rich people power without explicitly saying so. And since theoretically anyone can be rich, it’s easy for the intellectually gullible to mistake it as a democracy.</p>\n<p>Why is the economics profession so corrupted? Because economists are funded by corporations to produce research to advance their agenda (eg. “Inside Job” movie).</p>\n<p>So despite the fact that much of economics is politics and opinion, it somehow gets a special level of clout in the political world. And the profession has been hijacked to advocate the neoliberal agenda (from Econ 101), which basically advocates funneling power to those with money.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/c7eb9/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"money\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/c739e/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/8ee9c/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 148w,\n/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/ebbe7/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 295w,\n/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/c739e/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 590w,\n/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/5413e/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 885w,\n/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/4efde/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 1180w,\n/static/91f47372081e8fb94f07e75022c8550f/c7eb9/sharon-mccutcheon-rItGZ4vquWk-unsplash.jpg 5616w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If we really wanted everyone who wants a job to be able to find one, we’d implement a jobs guarantee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we really wanted to end poverty and financial insecurity, we’d implement something like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income\">Universal Basic Income</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we really wanted to end outrageous levels of student loan debt, we’d 1. forgive student loan debt 2. reform publicly-funded universities to force them to charge more reasonable tuition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we really wanted people to spend more money, we’d give people money (instead of bulge bracket banks)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we really wanted to make housing more affordable and end involuntary homelessness, we’d build more modest homes and prioritize access to those who actually need them (eg. rather than investors and foreign money launderers)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we don’t do any of these things. Either because we don’t think they’re feasible, or because we don’t care.</p>\n<p>I find it hard to believe that it’s because we don’t care.</p>\n<p>I think the main reason is because <strong>the economics profession has convinced the public that we can’t afford these things.</strong> - that taxes would have to be jacked up so much that we’d end up like the Soviet Union and we’d all starve to death (not that that reasoning makes any sense).</p>\n<p>The biggest lie that we’re sold is that the <a href=\"/modern-monetary-theory\">primary constraint here is the government budget</a>.</p>\n<p>This was a legitimate argument when money was still backed by gold, and thus we couldn’t print more money than our gold reserves. But in today’s age of sovereign fiat money and floating exchange rates, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory\">there is no money supply constraint - only an inflation constraint</a>.</p>\n<p>The idea that government deficits don’t matter is a tough pill to swallow because it’s unintuitive and runs counter to everything we’ve been taught. Could it really be that all those politicians who were holding the U.S. Treasury hostage over the debt ceiling were bickering about nothing all along?</p>\n<p><strong>The real constraint is political will.</strong> We can solve poverty tomorrow. We just choose not to because neoliberalism and McCarthyism have won over the political discourse. Those who debate the Democrat’s establishment candidate vs. the Republican’s establishment candidate have already lost the debate, like a fat kid debating between a Twinkie and a Zebra cake.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/ffbed/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fast food\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/c739e/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/8ee9c/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 148w,\n/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/ebbe7/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 295w,\n/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/c739e/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 590w,\n/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/5413e/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 885w,\n/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/4efde/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 1180w,\n/static/349c290440177ab5ef37c6f9dcaaeb68/ffbed/carles-rabada-reZbnolscDo-unsplash.jpg 6000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>So next time someone objects to your political preference by shouting “you don’t understand economics!”, respond by saying that neither do economists.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Let me just clarify that I’m not an economist, nor did I study economics.
