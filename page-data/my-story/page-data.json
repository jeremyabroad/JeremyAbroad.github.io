I started in South America, spent 4 months in Europe, and then moved to Asia.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been one to naturally question everything - starting in <a href=\"/school-crime-humanity/\">school</a> when I’d wonder why we were all forced to complete hours of busywork and <a href=\"/lectures-suck/\">learn</a> this random stuff despite the fact that we’d forget most of it after the exam - to <a href=\"/why-jobs-suck-perception-management\">work</a> where I’d wonder why <a href=\"/9-5-jobs/\">everyone has to sit there in the office for 8 hours</a> if one can work <a href=\"/how-to-work-efficiently/\">twice as productively</a> and finish everything in 4 while <a href=\"/remote-work\">working from home</a> and saving the hour-long roundtrip commute (hint: <a href=\"/why-jobs-suck-perception-management/\">perception is everything</a>). Or why we preach the superiority of democracy in our government, yet have no issues with oligarchy in our workplace. Or the fact that we must still work 40+ hour work weeks despite the fact that technology/automation has advanced to a point where it is not necessary to sustaining our standard of living.</p>\n<p>Most people just accept things and move on. I’d imagine that’s what most Germans did during the Holocaust, or what most Americans did during slavery. To me it never felt like a morally defensible thing to idly stand by in the face of injustice. But since politics is taboo in today’s labor market, I understand why from a selfish perspective it makes more sense to keep silent.</p>\n<p>This blog is like a toned down version of the thoughts going on in my head. Until I’m financially independent enough to not have to care whether I’m employable, I’ll keep it “PG-13”.</p>\n<p>On a more personal level, I grew up always being the shyest kid in my class, but I hated being shy and did everything I could to overcome it. So naturally I have an interest in personal development.</p>\n<p>I don’t have all the answers, but I’m documenting my thoughts here. Take it or leave it.</p>\n<p>If you want to hire me for remote work, you can find my <a href=\"https://www.jbernier.com/resume.pdf\">resume</a> and contact at <a href=\"https://www.jbernier.com\">jbernier.com</a>, my personal website. I’m pretty good at coding in Javascript and building complex single-page web apps (built <a href=\"https://www.vroom.com\">vroom.com</a>, worked on <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com\">iheart.com</a>).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Story (short version)","date":"September 25, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/my-story/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/credit-cards/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Credit Cards I Use and Recommend","tags":["travel"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hostels/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hostels are Amazing (1 week of hostel life in Kiev)","tags":["travel"]}}}}}
