When I told him I’d been living in NYC, his reaction was “oh wow. I don’t know how anyone lives there, it’s too much ‘city’ for me.”</p>\n<p>This actually seems to be the most common reaction I get when I’m abroad. And after leaving NYC and seeing many other cities, I can see why.</p>\n<p>NYC, particularly Manhattan, is truly unique among major developed cities in how dense and congested it is. But unlike a city like Tokyo which is also dense but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCU2OkSVHWU\">feels comfortable</a>, Manhattan just feels overcrowded. The South African hit the nail on the head when he called out the nonstop ear-piercing police/ambulance sirens, one of my least favorite parts of the city (there’s a dead simple solution to fixing this problem: <em>turn the f*cking volume down</em>).</p>\n<p>I started my world tour thinking I’d analyze all of these world cities and compare them to NYC, but I realized early on that NYC is so unique in its overcongestedness. Compared to NYC, virtually every city feels relatively comfortable (except for somewhere like New Delhi).</p>\n<p><strong>What about Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx?</strong></p>\n<p>The reality is that most companies have offices in Manhattan, and so living in the outer boroughs means you’ll have to spend 20-60 minutes commuting to Manhattan. Under a typical 9am-5pm work Monday-Friday, this means you’ll be spending the bulk of your day in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Sure if you can work from home then you can live in any borough, but if you can work from anywhere why on earth would you choose to live in a city as expensive as NYC?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Of course NYC has a lot of other positives that may overtake the negatives and make it worth living in for a couple years. But I think the overcongestedness and high cost of living disqualifies it as a comfortable place to live in long-term.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Foreigner's Impression of NYC","date":"September 27, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/foreigners-impression-nyc/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cold-weather/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cold Weather","tags":["travel"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ideal-work-schedule/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ideal Work Schedule","tags":null}}}}}
